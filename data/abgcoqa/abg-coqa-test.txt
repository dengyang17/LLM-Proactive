      "story": "An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated to a high temperature, by passing an electric current through it, until it glows with visible light (incandescence). The hot filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections. \n\nIncandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- The 54-year-old Michigan tree trimmer severely beaten after he accidentally struck a child who had stepped into the street earlier this month is breathing on his own, according to his daughter. \n\n\"He is off the ventilator and is able to breathe on his own,\" Mandi Marie Utash posted Friday to a GoFundMe.com page she and her brother set up for their father, who they say does not have health insurance. \n\nSteven Utash was set upon by about a dozen people after his truck struck a 10-year-old boy, police said. After Utash stopped his vehicle to help the boy, he was \"severely beaten\" with \"fists and feet,\" Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement. \n\nAuthorities credited a woman who stepped in as Utash was being attacked with saving his life. \n\nMandi Marie Utash wrote that her father doesn't seem to know what happened to him or why he was in the hospital, but that he is able to wiggle his toes on command and answer yes or no questions. \"These are baby steps,\" she says. \n\nShe wrote that her father \"keeps flashing back to the assault screaming for \"HELP\" and \"PLEASE GET THEM OFF ME.\" \n\n\"This is a long road ahead,\" she said. \"But the end of the road will be worth it.\" \n\nSteven Utash had previously been in a medically induced coma. \n\nJennifer Moreno, a police spokeswoman, told CNN that all of the alleged assailants were African-American and that none are known to be related to the boy or his family. She said the beating was \"a spontaneous response.\" Utash is white. ",

      "story": "When he was a teenager, Hunter Adam was very unhappy and he spent many years in a special hospital for people with mental health problems. When he left the hospital, Adam decided to become a doctor, so he went to a medical school in Virginia, USA. But when he was there, he did things in a different way. For example, he didn't like the doctor's white coats, so he wore shirts with flowers on them when he visited his patients and he tried to make them laugh. The doctors at the medical school didn't like Adams because he was too different. But Adams believed that people in hospital need more than medicine. He saw unhappy and lonely people, and he tried to help them as patients, but as people too. He spent a lot of time with children in the hospital and often dressed up like a clown to make the children laugh When he finished medical school and become a doctor, Adams opened his own hospital, called \"the Gusundheit Institute\",together with some other doctors. They wanted it to be a place with a different way of working with sick people. Hunter Adams became famous during the 1980s, and in 1988, Universal Pictures made a film about his life. It was very successful. In the film, Robin Williams played Adams. Williams said,:\"hunter is a really warm person, who believes that patients need a doctor who is a friend. I enjoyed playing him.\"",

      "story": "Why does most of the world travel on the right side today? Theories differ, but there's no doubt that Napoleon was a major influence. The French had used the right since at least the late 18th century. Some say that before the French Revolution, noblemen drove their carriages on the left, forcing the peasants to the right. Regardless of the origin, Napoleon brought right-hand traffic to the nations he conquered, including Russia, Switzerland and Germany. Hitler, in turn, ordered right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia and Austria in the 1930s. Nations that escaped right-hand control, like Great Britain, followed their left-hand tradition. \n\nThe U.S. has not always been a nation of right-hand rivers; earlier in its history, carriage and horse traffic traveled on the left, as it did in England. But by the late 1700s, people driving large wagons pulled by several pairs of horses began promoting a shift to the right. A driver would sit on the rear left horse in order to wave his whip with his right hand; to see opposite traffic clearly, they traveled on the right. \n\nOne of the final moves to firmly standardize traffic directions in the U.S. occurred in the 20th century, when Henry Ford decided to mass-produce his cars with controls on the left (one reason, stated in 1908; the convenience for passengers exiting directly onto the edge, especially... if there is a lady to be considered). Once these rules were set, many countries eventually adjusted to the right-hand standard, including Canada in the 1920s, Sweden in 1967 and Burma in 1970. The U.K. and former colonies such as Australia and India are among the western world's few remaining holdouts. Several Asian countries, including Japan, use the left as well -- thought many places use both right-hand-drive and left-hand-drive cars.",

      "story": "Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor of the apartment building. For years, he had always been planning to paint a work of art, but had never yet begun it. He earned a little money by serving as a model to artists who could not pay for a professional model. He was a fierce, little, old man who protected the two young women in the studio apartment above him. \n\nSue found Behrman in his room. In one area was a blank canvas that had been waiting twenty-five years for the first line of paint. Sue told him about Johnsy and how she feared that her friend would float away like a leaf on the old ivy vine climbing hopelessly up the outside block wall. \n\nOld Behrman was angered at such an idea. \"Are there people in the world with the foolishness to die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly business come in her brain?\" \n\n\"She is very sick and weak,\" said Sue, \"and the disease has left her mind full of strange ideas.\" \n\n\"This is not any place in which one so good as Miss Johnsy shall lie sick,\" yelled Behrman. \"Some day I will paint a masterpiece, and we shall all go away.\" \n\nJohnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. She and Behrman went into the other room. They looked out a window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other without speaking. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. \n\nThe next morning, Sue awoke after an hour's sleep. She found Johnsy with wide-open eyes staring at the covered window. \"Pull up the shade; I want to see,\" she ordered, quietly. Sue obeyed. \n\nAfter the beating rain and fierce wind that blew through the night, there yet stood against the wall one ivy leaf. It was the last one on the vine. It was still dark green at the center. But its edges were color1ed with the yellow. It hung bravely from the branch about seven meters above the ground. \n\n\"It is the last one,\" said Johnsy. \"I thought it would surely fail during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.\" \n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said Sue, leaning her worn face down toward the bed. \"Think of me, if you won't think of yourself. What would I do?\" But Johnsy did not answer. \n\nThe next morning, when it was light, Johnsy demanded that the window shade be raised. The ivy leaf was still there. Johnsy lay for a long time, looking at it. And then she called to Sue, who was preparing chicken soup. \n\n\"I've been a bad girl,\" said Johnsy. \"Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how bad I was. It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.\" \n\nAn hour later she said: \"someday I hope to paint the Bay of Naples.\" \n\nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hallway. \"Even chances. With good care, you'll win,\" said the doctor. \"And now I must see another case I have in your building. Behrman, whose name is some kind of an artist, I believe, has Pneumonia , too. He is an old, weak man and his case is severe. There is no hope for him, but he goes to the hospital today to ease his pain.\" \n\nThe next day, the doctor said to Sue:\" She's out of danger. You won. Nutrition and care now - that's all.\" \n\nLater that day, Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, and put one arm around her. \"I have something to tell you, white mouse,\" she said, \"Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today in the hospital. He was sick only two days. They found him the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain. His shoes and clothing were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night. \n\n\"And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been moved from its place. And art supplies and a painting board with green and yellow color1s mixed on it. \n\n\"Look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn't you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman's masterpiece - he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.\"",

It had been placed there since my last visit, and that same day I pushed Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across the landing and round the other room, which, from that day on, became my regular job. \n\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, my sister's husband; then I explained my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help. But, she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money - or anything but my daily dinner - nor even mentioned that I should be paid for my services. \n\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me; sometimes, she would be seemingly kind to me; sometimes, she would be quite familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, \"Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said yes, Miss Havisham would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would hold her tightly with great fondness, saying something quietly in her ear that sounded like \"Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\"",

But nothing worked. \n\nAt one point, Sikes said he reached down to try to pull the accelerator up, but it \"stayed right where it was.\" \n\nAlerted by emergency dispatchers, a California Highway Patrol officer was able to catch up to Sikes' Prius and used the patrol car's public address system to instruct Sikes to apply the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time. \n\nThe tactic worked, and the car slowed to about 50 mph. Sikes said he was able to shut off the car, and it rolled to a stop. The responding officer, Todd Neibert, positioned his patrol car in front of the Prius as a precaution to prevent it from moving again. ",

Distracted , Amanda turned left and right, then crashed into another car. \n\nLuckily she wasn't in a real car. She was in a driving simulator at Roosevelt High School, Ohio, US.\"I never really realized you swerve that much,\" Amanda, a junior, said. She added that she doesn't text while driving any more. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and State Highway Patrol brought the simulator to the school. They said they wanted to help students learn about the dangers of driving drunk, while texting, or while talking on the phone. \n\nLast year, state authorities reported 39 fatalities , 454 serious injuries and 12,410 crashes caused by distracted driving. Experts said that real numbers are probably higher. \n\nThe simulator is basically a computer game. Like many computer games, it was a hit with the students. They lined up and crowded around to watch each other take turns. The simulator has a steering wheel , brake and gas pedals . It is made up of three large computer screens on a table. \n\nStudents choose a distraction, for example driving drunk or driving while texting. They always crash, of course. Then they are pulled over by police, and learn the bad results of their driving: how much damage they've caused, what their fine is, if anyone died in the accident, and if they're going to go to prison. \n\n\"It teaches how to drive without being on the road,\" said Shante Thompson, 16. She had just crashed into a deer. \n\nODOT spokesman Justin Chesnic said hundreds of kids have gone behind the wheel so far. He said even more have benefited from watching their classmates. \n\n\"Driving is such a major responsibility, so take it seriously,\" he said. \"Put away your cell phone. Don't put your makeup on. Don't be eating or playing with the radio. \n\n\"A lot of the accidents out there are because of distracted driving. It cannot only change your life, but it can change someone else's life forever. The results are serious.\"MCT",

Watch whether Omar bin Laden thinks his father will ever be caught \u00bb \n\nHe said he hasn't spoken to his father since 2000, when he walked away from an al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan with his father's blessings. He said he has no idea where his father is, but is confident he will never be caught because locals support him. \n\nAsked if his father might be living along the Afghan-Pakistan border, he said, \"Maybe, maybe not.\" ",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Wednesday night's CNN debate lands at a critical moment in the Republican race. \n\nThis season, each debate has set the tone for the primary to follow. Newt Gingrich's savaging of the media helped propel him to victory in South Carolina. Mitt Romney's savaging of Gingrich helped him to clinch Florida. The current uncertainty about the race, and the extraordinary elasticity in the polls, is partly due to the fact that we haven't had a debate for a whole month. \n\nIt's important, then, for each of the candidates to make a powerful impression in this last confrontation before Arizona and Michigan vote on February 28. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich will compete over who is the most conservative, and Ron Paul will push his unique brand of libertarianism. Same old, same old. But we might see something new from Mitt Romney: a glimmer of humanity. \n\nThe latest CNN/Time/ORC International Poll shows that Santorum is closing the gap on Romney in Arizona, but it's probably in Michigan that he stands the best chance of scoring an upset. A week ago, polls put Santorum as much as 10 points ahead in the Great Lakes State. But now they call it a statistical dead heat between him and Romney. \n\nSo it would serve Santorum well to hit Mitt hard in the debate. This is Rick's natural style -- he gets a thrill out of counting the flaws of his opponents. But Santorum also probably recognizes that the only way he'll win Michigan is by reminding voters of the doubts that they have about Romney's conservatism. That's what he's been doing in the western part of the state all this week, where he has hit out repeatedly at Romney's \"well-oiled weathervane\" stance on issues like abortion and Iran. ",

A country scores higher HDI when the life expectancy at birth is longer, the education period is longer, and the income per capita is higher. The HDI was developed by the Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq, often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in their life, and was published by the United Nations Development Programme. \n\nThe 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality),\" and \"the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality).\"",

His rush was aimed at Henry, but missing that youth, he went onward with a wild plunge, directly between Dave and Barringford. \n\n\"A buck!\" yelled the frontiersman. \"Back out, Dave, an' be quick about it!\" \n\nHe himself started on a run, reloading his rifle as he went. Dave wanted to do as bidden, but he had been so surprised that before he could turn his heel caught on a rock and down he went flat on his back. His gun struck on the trigger and went off, the charge tearing over the top of the cave into the tree branches beyond. \n\nDave was now helpless and if the truth must be told the fall had more than half dazed him, for his head came down on a spot that was far from soft and comfortable. More than this, with an empty gun he could do but little to defend himself. \n\nThe big buck had now come to a halt and turned around. He stood as if uncertain whether to renew the attack or take to his heels. Then he gazed at his mate and a strange red light shone in his angry eyes. He was \"blood struck,\" as old hunters call it, and drawing in a sharp, hissing breath, he leaped forward once again, straight for Dave, who was now trying to rise. ",

It is a remote and inhospitable collection of islands, consisting of South Georgia and a chain of smaller islands known as the South Sandwich Islands. South Georgia is long and wide and is by far the largest island in the territory. The South Sandwich Islands lie about southeast of South Georgia. The territory's total land area is . The Falkland Islands are about north-west from its nearest point. \n\nThere is no permanent population on the islands. The present inhabitants are the British Government Officer, Deputy Postmaster, scientists, and support staff from the British Antarctic Survey who maintain scientific bases at Bird Island and at the capital, King Edward Point, as well as museum staff at nearby Grytviken. \n\nThe United Kingdom claimed sovereignty over South Georgia in 1775 and the South Sandwich Islands in 1908. The territory of \"South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\" was formed in 1985; previously it had been governed as part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies. Argentina claimed South Georgia in 1927 and claimed the South Sandwich Islands in 1938. \n\nArgentina maintained a naval station, Corbeta Uruguay, on Thule Island in the South Sandwich Islands from 1976 until 1982 when it was closed by the Royal Navy. The Argentine claim over South Georgia contributed to the 1982 Falklands War, during which Argentine forces briefly occupied the island. Argentina continues to claim sovereignty over South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.",

      "story": "Bhutan, officially the Kingdom of Bhutan, is a landlocked country in South Asia. Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it is bordered by Tibet Autonomous Region in the north, India in the south, the Sikkim state of India and the Chumbi Valley of Tibet in the west, and Arunachal Pradesh state of India in the east. Bhutan is geopolitically in South Asia and is the region's second least populous nation after the Maldives. Thimphu is its capital and largest city, while Phuntsholing is its financial center. \n\nThe independence of Bhutan has endured for centuries, and the territory was never colonized in its history. Situated on the ancient Silk Road between Tibet, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, the Bhutanese state developed a distinct national identity based on Buddhism. Headed by a spiritual leader known as the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, the territory was composed of many fiefdoms and governed as a Buddhist theocracy. Following a civil war in the 19th century, the House of Wangchuck reunited the country and established relations with the British Empire. Bhutan fostered a strategic partnership with India during the rise of Chinese communism and has a disputed border with the People's Republic of China. In 2008, it transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy and held the first election to the National Assembly of Bhutan, that has a two party system characterizing Bhutanese democracy.",

So, he did not hide the letter where he knew they would look for it. \n\n\"Do you remember how Germont laughed when I said the mystery was difficult for him to solve because it was so simple?\" \n\nDupin filled his pipe with tobacco and lit it. \"Well, the more I thought about it, the more I realized the police could not find the letter because D'Arcy had not hidden it at all. \n\n\"So I went to visit D'Arcy in his apartment. I took a pair of dark green eyeglasses with me. I explained to him that I was having trouble with my eyes and needed to wear the dark glasses at all times. He believed me. The glasses permitted me to look around the apartment while I seemed only to be talking to him. \n\n\"I paid special attention to a large desk where there were a lot of papers and books. However, I saw nothing suspicious there. After a few minutes, however, I noticed a small shelf over the fireplace. A few postcards and a letter were lying on the shelf. The letter looked very old and dirty. \n\n\"As soon as I saw this letter, I decided it must be the one I was looking for. It must be, even though it was completely different from the one Germont had described. \n\n\"This letter had a large green stamp on it. The address was written in small letters in blue ink. I memorized every detail of the letter while I talked to D'Arcy. Then when he was not looking, I dropped one of my gloves on the floor under my chair. \n\n\"The next morning, I stopped at his apartment to look for my glove. While we were talking, we heard people shouting in the street. D'Arcy went to the window and looked out. Quickly, I stepped to the shelf and put the letter in my pocket. Then I replaced it with a letter that looked exactly like it, which I had made it the night before. \n\n\"The trouble in the street was caused by a man who had almost been run over by a horse and carriage. He was not hurt. And soon the crowd of people went away. When it was over, D'Arcy came away from the window. I said goodbye and left. \n\n\"The man who almost had an accident was one of my servants . I had paid him to create the incident.\" \n\nDupin stopped talking to light his pipe. I did not understand. \"But, Dupin,\" I said, \"why did you go to the trouble of replacing the letter? Why not just take it and leave?\" \n\nDupin smiled. \"D'Arcy is a dangerous man,\" he said. \"And he has many loyal servants.

Munich is also the third largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and the 12th biggest city of the European Union, with a population of around 1.5\u00a0million. The Munich Metropolitan Region is home to 6 million people. \n\nThe city is a major centre of art, advanced technologies, finance, publishing, culture, innovation, education, business, and tourism in Germany and Europe and enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and fourth worldwide according to the 2015 Mercer survey. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute Munich is considered an alpha-world city, . \n\nThe name of the city is derived from the Old/Middle High German term \"Munichen\", meaning \"by the monks\", which in turn is derived from M\u00f6nch (which in the end derives from ancient Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2). It derives from the monks of the Benedictine order, who ran a monastery at the place that was later to become the Old Town of Munich; hence the monk depicted on the city's coat of arms. Munich was first mentioned in 1158. From 1255 the city was seat of the Bavarian Dukes. Black and gold \u2013 the colours of the Holy Roman Empire \u2013 have been the city's official colours since the time of Ludwig the Bavarian, when it was an imperial residence. Following a final reunification of the Wittelsbachian Duchy of Bavaria, previously divided and sub-divided for more than 200 years, the town became the country's sole capital in 1506.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- An alleged new case of waterboarding emerged in a massive report Thursday detailing brutal CIA interrogations of Libyan detainees last decade before they were handed over to Moammar Gadhafi's regime. \n\nMohammed al-Shoroeiya \"provided detailed and credible testimony that he was waterboarded on repeated occasions during U.S. interrogations in Afghanistan,\" Human Rights Watch said in a 200-plus page report. \n\nThe allegations directly challenge long-standing claims by President George W. Bush and his administration that only three terror suspects, none of whom were Libyan, were waterboarded during interrogations. \n\nHuman rights groups consider waterboarding -- in which a prisoner is restrained and water poured over his mouth and nose to produce the sensation of drowning -- a form of torture. \n\n\"While never using the phrase 'waterboarding,' he said that after his captors put a hood over his head and strapped him onto a wooden board, 'then they start with the water pouring. ... They start to pour water to the point where you feel like you are suffocating.' He added that 'they wouldn't stop until they got some kind of answer from me,'\" the report said. \n\nLaura Pitter, a counterterrorism adviser for Human Rights Watch and the author of the report, said abuses occurred in U.S.-run facilities in Afghanistan between April 2003 and April 2005. She said waterboarding occurred in 2003 but it is not clear if it occurred afterward. \n\nThe rights group's accusations come a week after the U.S. Justice Department closed a criminal investigation without charges into the deaths of two terror suspects in CIA custody.

As the most populous city in the province, the 2016 census recorded 631,486 people in the city, up from 603,502 in 2011. The Greater Vancouver area had a population of 2,463,431 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada. Vancouver has the highest population density in Canada with over 5,400 people per square kilometre. With over 250,000 residents, Vancouver is the fourth-most densely populated city in North America behind New York City, San Francisco, and Mexico City according to the 2011 census. Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada according to that census; 52% of its residents have a first language other than English. Vancouver is classed as a Beta global city. \n\nVancouver is consistently named as one of the top five worldwide cities for livability and quality of life, and the Economist Intelligence Unit acknowledged it as the first city ranked among the top-ten of the world's most well-living cities for five consecutive years. Vancouver has hosted many international conferences and events, including the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, UN Habitat I, Expo 86, the World Police and Fire Games in 1989 and 2009; and the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler, a resort community north of the city. In 2014, following thirty years in California, the TED conference made Vancouver its indefinite home. Several matches of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup were played in Vancouver, including the final at BC Place.",

It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated as first-class, the other being the state's second-largest city of Lexington. Louisville is the historical seat and, since 2003, the nominal seat of Jefferson County. \n\nLouisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark and is named after King Louis XVI of France, making Louisville one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachian Mountains. Sited beside the Falls of the Ohio, the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, the settlement first grew as a portage site. It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which grew into a system across 13 states. Today, the city is known as the home of the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Fried Chicken, the University of Louisville and its Louisville Cardinals athletic teams, Louisville Slugger baseball bats, and three of Kentucky's six \"Fortune\" 500 companies. Its main airport is also the site of United Parcel Service's worldwide air hub. \n\nSince 2003, Louisville's borders have been the same as those of Jefferson County because of a city-county merger. The official name of this consolidated city-county government is the Louisville/Jefferson\u00a0County Metro\u00a0Government, abbreviated to Louisville\u00a0Metro. Despite the merger and renaming, the term \"Jefferson County\" continues to be used in some contexts in reference to Louisville Metro, particularly including the incorporated cities outside the \"balance\" which make up Louisville proper. The city's total consolidated population as of the 2014 census estimate was 760,026. However, the balance total of 612,780 excludes other incorporated places and semiautonomous towns within the county and is the population listed in most sources and national rankings.",

An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, is done under color of law or involves trading in influence. \n\nForms of corruption vary, but include bribery, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, gombeenism, parochialism patronage, influence peddling, graft, and embezzlement. Corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking, though is not restricted to these activities. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality, is also considered political corruption. \n\nThe activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or ill-defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions. Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually. A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a kleptocracy, literally meaning \"rule by thieves\".",

A VJ(video jockey) is a person who introduces music videos on television. \n\nVJs were first seen on television in the early 1980s when MTV went on the air. As MTV became popular, and the audience for music videos expanded, a variety of other music video channels started broadcasting. In addition to rock music, there were channels for people who had a lot of interest in alternative kinds of music, such as country music, light music, and R&B(rhythm and blues), and all of these channels needed VJs. By the 1990s, international music video channels like Channel V in Asia and VIVA in Europe had started. \n\nThe VJs for the new international stations had to be chosen carefully. Although some VJs did shows that focused on small audiences and showed mostly local content, other VJs presented shows for international viewers. These VJs, and the material they presented, needed to be popular in several different cultures. \n\nOne successful international VJ in Asia is Asha Gill. She is from prefix = st1 /Malaysia, but her parents and grandparents are fromIndia,FranceandEngland.

But the historically high price of products is making it an even bigger drag on the bottom line. \n\nRestaurants, colleges, hospitals and other institutions are compensating for the rising costs of waste in novel ways. Some are tracking their trash with software systems, making food in smaller packages or trying to compost (......) and cut down on trash-hauling costs. \n\n\"We have all come to work with this big elephant in the middle of kitchen, and the elephant is this 'It's okay to waste' belief system,\" said Andrew Shackman, president of LeanPath, a company that helps restaurants cut back food waste. \n\nThe interest in cutting food waste \"has just rocketed in the last six to nine months,\" he said. \n\nRoughly 30 percent of food in the United States goes to waste, costing some $48 billion annually, according to a Stockholm International Water Institute study. A University of Arizona study estimated that 40 to 50 percent of food in the United States is wasted. Wholesale food costs have risen more than 8 percent this year, the biggest jump in decades, according to the National Restaurant Association. \n\nFreshman students at Virginia Tech were surprised this year when the two of the campus' biggest dining halls to find there were no trays. \n\n\"You have to go back and get your dishware and your drink, but it's not that different,\" said Caitlin Mewborn, a freshman. \"It's not a big trouble. You take less food, and you don't eat more than you should.\" \n\nGetting rid of trays has cut food waste by 38 percent at the dining halls, said Denny Cochrane, manager of Virginia Tech's sustainability program.

Have you ever wondered what these successful athletes eat to stay in peak shape? \n\nKeri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life Meals, appeared on \"Good Morning America\" today to give you a glimpse into the diets of some top athletes. Some of their meals could surprise you. \n\nCrazy Calorie Count \n\n_ One secret of swimmer Michael Phelps' astonishing performance in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day. \n\nAthletes can eat like this and not gain any weight because their workouts are intense. According to Glassman, Phelps' workouts can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories in a day, and those calories must be replenished in order to train the following day. \n\nSnacking Secrets \n\nSome athletes eat wacky (strange, unusual) foods that they swear improve their performance. Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter and 100-meter world champion, has been making waves for stealing champion sprinter Usain Bolt's thunder on the track during the Olympic trials. Asked about how he gets his stamina, Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day, Glassman said. \n\nJonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem. His solution is honey. When he starts to feel shaky at the gym, he takes swigs of honey to boost his energy, Glassman said. \n\nFoods for Recovery \n\nWhat are the best foods to help the body recover after rigorous (strict) competition? \n\nFor Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, the recovery meal is grilled chicken breasts with Alfredo sauce, whole-grain spaghetti and a salad with lemon juice and olive oil. Lochte, who recently cut out junk food, candy and soda, has undertaken a rigorous strength-training regimen that involves flipping tractor tires, dragging shipyard chains and tossing beer kegs, Glassman said.",

I guess you have done it. I know I have. Peter Rabbit has done it often and then laughed at himself afterwards. I suspect that even shrewd, clever old Granny Fox has been guilty of it more than once. So it is not surprising that Reddy Fox, terribly hungry as he was, should do a little foolish wishing. \n\nWhen he left home to go to the Old Pasture, in the hope that he would be able to find something to eat there, he started off bravely. It was cold, very cold indeed, but his fur coat kept him warm as long as he was moving. The Green Meadows were glistening white with snow. All the world, at least all that part of it with which Reddy was acquainted, was white. It was beautiful, very beautiful, as millions of sparkles flashed in the sun. But Reddy had no thought for beauty; the only thought he had room for was to get something to put in the empty stomachs of himself and Granny Fox. \n\nJack Frost had hardened the snow so that Reddy no longer had to wade through it. He could run on the crust now without breaking through. This made it much easier, so he trotted along swiftly. He had intended to go straight to the Old Pasture, but there suddenly popped into his head a memory of the shelter down in a far corner of the Old Orchard which Farmer Brown's boy had built for Bob White.

Did your eminence visit the Pellegrini?\" This was the hospital, where Miss Arundel had found Lothair. \n\nThe cardinal looked grave. \"No,\" he replied. \"My object was to secure for our young friend some interesting but not agitating distraction from certain ideas which, however admirable and transcendently important, are nevertheless too high and profound to permit their constant contemplation with impunity to our infirm natures. Besides,\" he added, in a lower, but still distinct tone, \"I was myself unwilling to visit in a mere casual manner the scene of what I must consider the greatest event of this century.\" \n\n\"But you have been there?\" inquired Lady St. Jerome. \n\nHis eminence crossed himself. \n\nIn the course of the evening Monsignore Catesby told Lothair that a grand service was about to be celebrated in the church of St. George: thanks were to be offered to the Blessed Virgin by Miss Arundel for the miraculous mercy vouchsafed to her in saving the life of a countryman, Lothair. \"All her friends will make a point of being there,\" added the monsignore, \"even the Protestants and some Russians. Miss Arundel was very unwilling at first to fulfil this office, but the Holy Father has commanded it. I know that nothing will induce her to ask you to attend; and yet, if I were you, I would turn it over in your mind. I know she said that she would sooner that you were present than all her English friends together. However, you can think about it. One likes to do what is proper.\" ",

The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6. \n\nThough Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including \"Practical Extraction and Reporting Language\". Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another. \n\nThe Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities. \n\nIn addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed \"the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages\" because of its flexibility and power, and also its ugliness. In 1998, it was also referred to as the \"duct tape that holds the Internet together\", in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.",

The same post had brought him a note from his organist; and that 'stupid old Dean' as he irreverently called him, had maliciously demanded 'How beautiful are the feet,' with the chorus following, and nobody in the choir was available to execute the solo but Lance. He had sung it once or twice before; and if he had the music, and would practise at home, he need only come up by the earliest train on the Epiphany morning; if not, he must arrive in time for a practice on the 5th; he would be wanted at both the festival and Sunday services, but might return as early as he pleased on Monday the 9th. \n\nLance did not receive the summons in an exemplary spirit. It is not certain that he did not bite it. He rolled on the floor, and contorted himself in convulsions of vexation; he 'bothered' the Dean, he 'bothered' the Precentor, he 'bothered' the Organist, he 'bothered' Shapcote's sore throat, he 'bothered' Harewood's wool- gathering wits, he 'bothered' his own voice, and thereby caused Clement to rebuke him for foolish murmurs instead of joy in his gift.

At the age of 7, Valdez set up an organization to give homeless kids things like slippers and toothbrushes. So far he has helped more than 10,000 children improve their lives in his hometown. Valdez won the 2012 International Children's Peace Prize on September 19, 2012. \"My motto is 'we can change the world one heart at a time,' \" Valdez said at the award ceremony. In fact, Valdez is a homeless kid himself. He looked for food from trash, lived on the streets and slept in a public cemetery for most of his childhood. His parents didn't care about him and often beat him. Valdez said he felt he was living in \" _ \" at that time. But this \"darkness\" didn't turn him into a dark person. Valdez got help from community workers. On his first birthday party, at the age of 7, Valdez decided what he wanted most was to help other children who were still living on the streets. \"I didn't have a lot of money, but I had a lot of love to give,\" Valdez explained. That day was the birth of the organization, Championing Community Children. Since then, Valdez and his friends visit homeless children and hand out bags with slippers, toys and even candy. They nurse their wounds, teach them about their rights and offer them hope. \"I want children on the streets to get the same chance as I have,\" he said.",

Julie's going to pick her up from school as usual on Friday but she's not taking her home. She's bringing her to the Palace Hotel, the big modern one near the station. We're having a meal there and we've also hired the ballroom for a party in the evening. I hope you can come! All her friends from school are coming and quite a few of the people from our village, too. Of course, Mum and Dad are coming up from England and I've managed to persuade our other sister, Marie, to come over from Australia. She's bringing her kids with her, too. After the party we're going to have another one on Saturday! Well, not really a party. We're inviting the family and close friends (that includes you) for a meal at the house. If the weather is nice, we'd like to have a barbecue in the garden. Julie's going to make a special cake for Suzie. Anyway, we hope to make it a really special weekend for Suzie. On Sunday we're all going for a walk in the country. You know how she loves walking and we're all going to need a bit of exercise after all that lovely food. We're hoping to go up to the lake. Marie said she wanted her kids to feed the ducks just like Suzie and she did when they were very young. I'm sure Suzie will love that too. It would be great if you could come over for the weekend. We would all love to see you. Let me know as soon as you can. Best, David",

She went as fast as she could towards the screams for help. She saw another lady bug with a broken wing lying on the ground.

Do you know the way back home?\" asked Jessie \"Don't worry Jessie, I know this area like the back of my wing I'll lead you home!\" Lucy said happily. \"Thank you so much!\" Jessie said happily. Lucy led Jessie straight home where he was given medicine to fix his broken wing. She was rewarded a medal and called a hero.

However, her grandmother took away all the money and put it in a bank account. Many students experienced the same thing as Chen. They got their gift money, only to immediately have it taken away. Xiong Shengyue, 14, from Nanjing, doesn't agree with the practice. \"I think the money should be the children's, \" she said. \" We should take care of it by ourselves.\" It is not that simple, said Chu Chaohui, a researcher at national Institute of Education Sciences. Giving gift money is used to show social status and develop relationships, he told Beijing Legal Evening News. Gift money has lost its traditional meaning of good will and has \"little to do with the children\". What's more, children don't earn the money through work. So he thought that parents should still play a big part in dealing with the money. But Yan Honglan, a mother of a 14-year-old boy in Beijing, has let her son be responsible for his gift money since the age of 8. \"I want to develop his financial skills, ' Yan said. She also added:\"No matter how you deal with the money, the most important thing is to make the children feel they're respected and trusted. Chen supported Yan's idea. She said that though she knew her grandmother wouldn't waste her gift money, she would feel happier if she could at least know how the money is spent. \"It would make me feel a little bit more grown-up,\" she said.",

He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \"Brotherly Leader\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism and serving as Chairperson of the African Union from 2009 to 2010. \n\nThe son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder, Gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, subsequently enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Founding a revolutionary cell within the military, in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic. Ruling by decree, he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments. Intent on pushing Libya towards \"Islamic socialism\", he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973 he initiated a \"Popular Revolution\" with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in The Green Book.",

Jesse Martin does not have to imagine: he is living in it. \n\nOn Dec. 7, 1998, at 17 years old, Jesse set sail from Melbourne, Australia on his boat, attempting to become the youngest person to sail alone and nonstop around the world. He sailed south of New Zealand, through the South Pacific, around South America, north on the Atlantic, back south past Africa, through the Indian Ocean and back to Melbourne. \n\nEven as a young child, Jesse had been an adventurer who traveled all over Europe and Asia with his parents. Born in Munich, Germany in 1981, he moved to Australia with his family when he was only two years old. They moved close to a rainforest in Cow Bay, about 3500kms north of Melbourne, where they built a small house with no electricity or running water. Jesse grew up at the beach enjoying the outdoors to its fullest. \n\nAt 14, he sailed for the first time with his father and brother, Beau. It was after this trip that he began to dream about sailing around the world. \n\nJesse's family played an important role. \"I was made to believe I could do anything.\" he says. Although, he says, there were others that were not so encouraging or supportive, \"People that I looked up to, respected and trusted told me I couldn't. Thankfully, I trusted myself. There were people that said that the boat couldn't be ready by the time I had to leave.\" However, through perseverance and belief in himself he was able to do what many told him was impossible. \n\nOn Oct.31, 1999, more than 10 months after he set sail, Jesse Martin went down in history as the youngest person to sail around the world alone, nonstop and unassisted.",

Venters heard a mournful howl from Ring, but Whitie was silent. The blacks settled into their fleet, long-striding gallop. The wind sweetly fanned Venters's hot face. From the summit of the first low-swelling ridge he looked back. Lassiter waved his hand; Jane waved her scarf. Venters replied by standing in his stirrups and holding high his sombrero. Then the dip of the ridge hid them. From the height of the next he turned once more. Lassiter, Jane, and the burros had disappeared. They had gone down into the Pass. Venters felt a sensation of irreparable loss. \n\n\"Bern--look!\" called Bess, pointing up the long slope. \n\nA small, dark, moving dot split the line where purple sage met blue sky. That dot was a band of riders. \n\n\"Pull the black, Bess.\" \n\nThey slowed from gallop to canter, then to trot. The fresh and eager horses did not like the check. \n\n\"Bern, Black Star has great eyesight.\" \n\n\"I wonder if they're Tull's riders. They might be rustlers. But it's all the same to us.\" \n\nThe black dot grew to a dark patch moving under low dust clouds. It grew all the time, though very slowly. There were long periods when it was in plain sight, and intervals when it dropped behind the sage. The blacks trotted for half an hour, for another half-hour, and still the moving patch appeared to stay on the horizon line. Gradually, however, as time passed, it began to enlarge, to creep down the slope, to encroach upon the intervening distance. ",

The main character in My Left Foot, based on the real story of cerebral palsy sufferer Christy Brown, can barely move his mouth to speak, but by controlling his left foot, he's able to express himself as an artist and poet. For his moving performance of Brown, Daniel Lewis won his first Academy Award for best actor. Shine (1996) Do you have a talent you're afraid to share with the world? David Helfgott seemed meant from childhood to be \"one of the truly great pianists,\" but the pressures of performing (and pleasing his father) resulted in a complete breakdown. Ten years in a mental institution didn't weaken Helfgott's musical gift: When he was rediscovered, he was playing concertos in a bar. Shine received s even Oscar nominations , and Geoffrey Rush won best actor for his performance of Helfgott. Life Is Beautiful (1997) Nothing's more powerful than the love between a parent and a child. In this heartbreaking Italian film, a father (Roberto Benigni) makes an unbelievable sacrifice for his 4-year-old son: trapped in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, the Jewish man convinces his boy that they are playing a complicated game. He manages to spare him the horror of the terrible war, and even in his final moments of life, keeps his son smiling and hopeful. Benigni won the best actor Oscar. Stand and Deliver (1988) Few people can inspire us more than a good teacher. Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos got Oscar nomination for best actor) is a great one.

The bug jumped for joy and said, \"Oh, that would be wonderful!\" The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep. \n\nThe next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. \"Thank you for letting me sleep here last night,\" said the butterfly. It was the bug! \"I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I won't forget your kindness.\" After speaking, the butterfly flew away. Stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, \"Goodbye!\"",

Her father died when Hetty was 30, and she inherited $1 million. When she herself died in 1916, she left almost $100 million to her two children. \n\nHetty made her money on the New York stock exchange. She was a financial genius. She made money so easily that people called her the Witch of Wall Street. But although she was one of the richest women in the world, she counted every cent and spent as little as possible. She didn't own a house, because she didn't want to pay taxes. So she and her children lived in cheap hotels. She spent almost nothing on clothes, and always wore the same long black dress. She washed it herself, but to save soap she only washed the bottom of the dress, where it touched the ground. Other people had their own offices, but Hetty used a desk in the bank where she kept her money, because it didn't cost anything. She sat in the bank and ate her sandwiches while she bought and sold stocks and shares. If the bank complained, she just moved all her money to another bank. \n\nHetty's family paid the price for her meanness. When she was 33 she married a millionaire, Edward Green, and they had two children. But Green lost all his money, so she left him. When her son, Ned, injured his knee, Hetty didn't want to pay for a doctor, so she took him to a free hospital for poor people. Unfortunately the doctor knew Hetty was rich and he asked for money. Hetty refused and took the boy away. His leg got worse and two years later doctors removed it. \n\nBut eventually Ned got his revenge . At the age of 81, Hetty had an argument with a shop assistant about the price of a bottle of milk. She became so angry that she had a heart attack and died. So Hetty's meanness finally killed her. Ned inherited half his mother's fortune, and he spent it all on parties, holidays and expensive jewellery.",

She asked her mother if she could go to the park. Her mother walked her down the street to the park. When Gia got to the park she was not happy. There was no one there. She sat on a swing and looked at the ground. It seemed like this was going to be another lonely day. Gia heard a noise and looked up. There was a girl coming down the hill. She smiled, but she was a little scared. What if she wasn't nice? That would make her sad. Gia was so happy when the girl walked up and said, \"Hi, my name is Julie. What's yours?\"",

      "story": "16:9 (1.7:1) (16:9 = 4:3) is an aspect ratio with a width of 16 units and height of 9. Since 2010 it has become the most common aspect ratio for televisions and computer monitors, and is also the international standard format of HDTV, Full HD, non-HD digital television and analog widescreen television. This has replaced the old . \n\nDr. Kerns H. Powers, a member of the SMPTE Working Group on High-Definition Electronic Production, first proposed the 16:9 (1.7:1) aspect ratio at a time when nobody was creating 16:9 videos. The popular choices in 1980 were: 1.3:1 (based on television standard's ratio at the time), 1.6:1 (the European \"flat\" ratio), 1.85:1 (the American \"flat\" ratio), 2.20:1 (the ratio of 70\u00a0mm films and Panavision) and 2.39:1 (the CinemaScope ratio for anamorphic widescreen films). \n\nPowers cut out rectangles with equal areas, shaped to match each of the popular aspect ratios. When overlapped with their center points aligned, he found that all of those aspect ratio rectangles fit within an outer rectangle with an aspect ratio of 1.7:1 and all of them also covered a smaller common inner rectangle with the same aspect ratio 1.7:1. The value found by Powers is exactly the geometric mean of the extreme aspect ratios, 4:3 (1.3:1) and 2.35:1 (or 64:27, see also for more information), \u221a \u2248 1.770 which is coincidentally close to 16:9 (1.7:1). Applying the same geometric mean technique to 16:9 and 4:3 yields the aspect ratio, which is likewise used as a compromise between these ratios.",

Established in 1986 as an independent national morning newspaper published in London, it was controlled by Tony O'Reilly's Independent News & Media from 1997 until it was sold to Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev in 2010. The last printed edition of \"The Independent\" was published Saturday 20 March 2016, leaving only its digital editions. \n\nNicknamed the \"Indy\", it began as a broadsheet, but changed to tabloid (compact) format in 2003. Until September 2011, the paper described itself on the banner at the top of every newspaper as \"free from party political bias, free from proprietorial influence\". It tends to take a pro-market stance on economic issues. \n\nThe daily edition was named \"National Newspaper of the Year\" at the 2004 British Press Awards. \n\nIn June 2015, it had an average daily circulation of just below 58,000, 85 per cent down from its 1990 peak, while the Sunday edition had a circulation of just over 97,000. \n\nLaunched in 1986, the first issue of \"The Independent\" was published on 7 October in broadsheet format. It was produced by Newspaper Publishing plc and created by Andreas Whittam Smith, Stephen Glover and Matthew Symonds.

During all that time, though they were both in London, she never saw Jack De Baron, and she knew that in not seeing her he was neglecting her. But for so long she bore it. It is generally supposed that young ladies have to bear such sorrow without loud complaint; but Guss was more thoroughly emancipated than are some young ladies, and when moved was wont to speak her mind. At last, when she herself was only on foot with her father, she saw Jack De Baron riding with Lady George. It is quite true that she also saw, riding behind them, her perfidious friend, Mrs. Houghton, and a gentleman whom at that time she did not know to be Lady George's father. This was early in March, when equestrians in the park are not numerous. Guss stood for a moment looking at them, and Jack De Baron took off his hat. But Jack did not stop, and went on talking with that pleasant vivacity which she, poor girl, knew so well and valued so highly. Lady George liked it too, though she could hardly have given any reason for liking it, for, to tell the truth, there was not often much pith in Jack's conversation. \n\nOn the following morning Captain De Baron, who had lodgings in Charles Street close to the Guards' Club, had a letter brought to him before he was out of bed. The letter was from Guss Mildmay, and he knew the handwriting well. He had received many notes from her, though none so interesting on the whole as was this letter. Miss Mildmay's letter to Jack was as follows. It was written, certainly, with a swift pen, and, but that he knew her writing well, would in parts have been hardly legible. ",

With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. \n\nOrganised prehistoric cultures began developing on current Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period. Its ancient history saw the presence of the Thracians, Greeks, Persians, Celts, Romans, Goths, Alans and Huns. The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, which dominated most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during the Middle Ages. With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396, its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378 led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a one-party socialist state as part of the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. In December 1989 the ruling Communist Party allowed multi-party elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a democracy and a market-based economy.",

      "story": "Anne and Joseph are talking about an interesting question. Why do some people change their names? There can be many reasons. Hanna changed her name to Anne because she thought it would be easier for people to remember. On the other hand, Joseph is thinking about changing his name to an unusual name because he wants to be different. \n\nPeople have a lot of reasons for changing their names. Film stars, singers, sportsmen and some other famous people often change their names because they want names that are not ordinary, or that have special sound. They chose the \"new name\" for themselves instead of the name their parents gave them when they were born. \n\nSome people have another reason for changing their names. They have moved to a new country and want to use a name that is usual there. For example, Li Kaiming changed his name to Ken Lee when he moved to the United States. He uses the name Ken at his job and at school. But with his family and Chinese friends, he uses Li Kaiming. For some people, using different names makes life easier in their new country. \n\nIn many countries, a woman changes her family name to her husband's after she gets married. But today, many women are keeping their own family name and not using their husband's. Sometimes, women use their own name in some situations and their husband's in other situations. And some use both their own name and their husband's.",

D. \n\nApollo Crosbie left London for Allington on the 31st of August, intending to stay there four weeks, with the declared intention of recruiting his strength by an absence of two months from official cares, and with no fixed purpose as to his destiny for the last of those two months. Offers of hospitality had been made to him by the dozen. Lady Hartletop's doors, in Shropshire, were open to him, if he chose to enter them. He had been invited by the Countess de Courcy to join her suite at Courcy Castle. His special friend, Montgomerie Dobbs, had a place in Scotland, and then there was a yachting party by which he was much wanted. But Mr Crosbie had as yet knocked himself down to none of these biddings, having before him when he left London no other fixed engagement than that which took him to Allington. On the first of October we shall also find ourselves at Allington in company with Johnny Eames; and Apollo Crosbie will still be there,--by no means to the comfort of our friend from the Income-tax Office. \n\nJohnny Eames cannot be called unlucky in that matter of his annual holiday, seeing that he was allowed to leave London in October, a month during which few chose to own that they remain in town. For myself, I always regard May as the best month for holiday-making; but then no Londoner cares to be absent in May. Young Eames, though he lived in Burton Crescent and had as yet no connection with the West End, had already learned his lesson in this respect. \"Those fellows in the big room want me to take May,\" he had said to his friend Cradell. \"They must think I'm uncommon green.\" ",

The dog was beautiful but was given up by its owners, as they did not want to take on the responsibility. \n\nLucas, a little boy, had a strange illness, a condition that stops the body's ability to process enzymes .As his life continues, he will lose the ability to speak and his physical and mental abilities will degrade till he is left in a vegetative state. The average life expectancy for the patients is 15 years. \n\nChester, the boy's father, wanted his child to enjoy his life on earth as much as possible and looked into getting a service dog for the child. However, Lucas wasn't a good candidate due to his deteriorating abilities, not to mention the $15,000 cost of the animal. \n\nNot terrified by all of this, Chester looked into adopting a dog for his son. He found Juno on a website and drove two hours to meet her. Chester had worked with the breed in the police force and was familiar with how to train them. He put in patience and hard work, and trained Juno while allowing her to become accustomed to Lucas. Now, not only will Juno not leave Lucas' side, she is also helping with his illness. Chester said, \"She has the ability to notice his neurological changes. Now she reminds us when Lucas is about to have a seizure or if his oxygen levels drop really low. She has saved him several times.\" \n\nCompanion animals are beautiful things and they establish a bond that can't be described without experiences.

During one vacation, Joe was preparing his home for the kids: cleaning and buying their favorite foods. After he finished working, he realized he lost his favorite watch. The watch was a gift from his wife when their first child was born. Joe loved the watch very much, especially after his wife's death. He was very upset about losing it. Once his grandchildren came, they promised him they would find the watch. One granddaughter asked: \"Grandpa, do you remember when you saw the watch last before it went missing?\" \"I guess when I was cleaning the barn !\" Joe replied. The children looked for more than two hours with Joe, but they could not find it. The kids were now also sad, but they tried to comfort their grandfather. One grandson went back to the barn to search again. Joe asked why he was going there a second time. But the little boy just asked the others not to follow him and to remain silent. He was there for about fifteen minutes and then rushed to his grandfather. He found the watch and happily gave it to Joe. Joe was surprised and asked how he was able to find it. The little boy replied: \"I sat there without making a noise, and the barn was so silent. After a few minutes, I heard the 'tick, tick' sound and found the watch.\" Joe hugged and thanked the little boy.",

      "story": "The International Meridian Conference was a conference held in October 1884 in Washington, D.C., in the United States, to determine a prime meridian for international use. The conference was held at the request of U.S. President Chester A. Arthur. The subject to discuss was the choice of \"a meridian to be employed as a common zero of longitude and standard of time reckoning throughout the world\". It resulted in selection of the Greenwich Meridian as the international standard for zero degrees longitude. \n\nBy the 1870s there was pressure both to establish a prime meridian for worldwide navigation purposes and to unify local times for railway timetables. The first International Geographical Congress, held in Antwerp in 1871, passed a motion in favour of the use of the Greenwich Meridian for (smaller scale) passage charts, suggesting that it should become mandatory within 15 years. In Britain, the Great Western Railway had standardised time by 1840 and in 1847 the \"Railway Clearing Union\" decreed that \"GMT be adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it\". The Post Office was by this time transmitting time signals from Greenwich by telegraph to most parts of the country to set the clocks. By January 1848, Bradshaw's railway guide showed the unified times and met with general approval, although legal disputes meant that it was not until 1890 that GMT was formally established across the UK.",

He was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian \"gens\" Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir, then known as Octavianus (Anglicized as Octavian). He, Mark Antony, and Marcus Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi, the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC. \n\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself \"Princeps Civitatis\" (\"First Citizen of the State\"). The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, the first phase of the Roman Empire.",

The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran, viewed by Muslims as the word of God, and the teachings and normative example (called the \"sunnah\", composed of accounts called \"hadith\") of Muhammad ( 570\u20138 June 632 CE). \n\nMuslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. As for the Quran, Muslims consider it to be the unaltered and final revelation of God. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded paradise and unrighteous punished in hell. Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, and following Islamic law, which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment. The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.",

Bob's trick of whirling was of especial moment to him. How to overcome it,--that was the thing. Suppose he did meet with Dede out in the hills; and suppose, by some lucky stroke of fate, he should manage to be riding alongside of her; then that whirl of Bob's would be most disconcerting and embarrassing. He was not particularly anxious for her to see him thrown forward on Bob's neck. On the other hand, suddenly to leave her and go dashing down the back-track, plying quirt and spurs, wouldn't do, either. \n\nWhat was wanted was a method wherewith to prevent that lightning whirl. He must stop the animal before it got around. The reins would not do this. Neither would the spurs. Remained the quirt. \n\nBut how to accomplish it? Absent-minded moments were many that week, when, sitting in his office chair, in fancy he was astride the wonderful chestnut sorrel and trying to prevent an anticipated whirl. One such moment, toward the end of the week, occurred in the middle of a conference with Hegan. Hegan, elaborating a new and dazzling legal vision, became aware that Daylight was not listening. His eyes had gone lack-lustre, and he, too, was seeing with inner vision. \n\n\"Got it\" he cried suddenly. \"Hegan, congratulate me. It's as simple as rolling off a log.

      "story": "The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, Mya. As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction events when 60% of marine species were wiped out. \n\nA significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of jawed and bony fish. Multi-cellular life also began to appear on land in the form of small, bryophyte-like and vascular plants that grew beside lakes, streams, and coastlines, and terrestrial arthropods are also first found on land during the Silurian. However, terrestrial life would not greatly diversify and affect the landscape until the Devonian. \n\nThe Silurian system was first identified by British geologist Roderick Murchison, who was examining fossil-bearing sedimentary rock strata in south Wales in the early 1830s. He named the sequences for a Celtic tribe of Wales, the Silures, inspired by his friend Adam Sedgwick, who had named the period of his study the Cambrian, from the Latin name for Wales. This naming does not indicate any correlation between the occurrence of the Silurian rocks and the land inhabited by the Silures. In 1835 the two men presented a joint paper, under the title \"On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales,\" which was the germ of the modern geological time scale. As it was first identified, the \"Silurian\" series when traced farther afield quickly came to overlap Sedgwick's \"Cambrian\" sequence, however, provoking furious disagreements that ended the friendship. Charles Lapworth resolved the conflict by defining a new Ordovician system including the contested beds. An early alternative name for the Silurian was \"\"Gotlandian\"\" after the strata of the Baltic island of Gotland.",

Two weeks after the dog's arrival, he was happier and calmer and said his first words, \"dog\" and \"mummy\". Just two months later, thieves stole the dog, and now the heartbroken little boy is back to where he started. He has refused to talk since losing his best friend.

None of his toys has ever held his attention that long. Now he has just completely turned quiet again. \"Harry suffers from a condition which affects his ability to speak and move. But the dog's being with him achieved more in days than months of speech therapy and physiotherapy had. Mrs Hainsworth says, \"My son was so happy when he saw Millie. Being with Millie changed him, and within two weeks he had said his first words and was working on saying 'dad'. Just last week, his teachers and I were saying how much Millie had helped him. And now this!\" Mrs Hainsworth is considering buying another pug in the hope that her son will accept it. Maureen Hennis of the charity, Pets as Therapy, says she has seen many cases of dogs helping people with speech problems. \"People may talk to a dog when they wouldn't like to talk to another human,\" she says. \"A dog doesn't care if words come out wrong.\"",

      "story": "(CNN) -- As senior World Cup photographer for leading agency Getty, Shaun Botterill has snapped pictures of every tournament since 1994. \n\nHe has found himself in some pretty privileged positions, capturing compelling images of football's greats -- and poignant, intimate shots away from the on-field action. \n\nSure, you have to be lucky to capture certain key moments when they happen, says Botterill. But he is also a firm believer in creating your own luck: being prepared when the magic unfolds on the pitch. \n\n\"I think knowledge of the sport is particularly important, because certain players have different styles,\" the Briton tells CNN's Sports Photo Masterclass series. \n\n\"A midfielder is more creative; he's always going to be looking for that pass. And you've got players like Ronaldo who will run a play -- he'll challenge plays, he'll make pictures. So that's where you get those big action shots. \n\n\"Generally the good players that just want to win and score make better pictures.\" \n\nIt's been said that eyes are the windows to the soul. Botterill says he's learned that focusing on players' eyes helps photographers to anticipate their moves. \n\nWhile covering the trophy ceremony at the 2006 World Cup in Germany -- a tournament he describes as one of his favorite events to have worked at -- Botterill caught a glimmer in Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro's eyes as he stood with his team for the presentation. \n\n\"Once Cannavaro got the trophy, he didn't just grab it,\" Botterill recalls. \n\n\"You could see he had something in his mind to do.

      "story": "Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto in Japan. \n\nAccording to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. \n\nRuby was conceived on February 24, 1993. In a 1999 post to the \"ruby-talk\" mailing list, Ruby author Yukihiro Matsumoto describes some of his early ideas about the language: \n\nMatsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl. \n\nThe name \"Ruby\" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: \"Coral\" and \"Ruby\". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka. Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name \"Ruby\"\u00a0\u2013 it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues. \n\nThe first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on December 21, 1995. Subsequently, three more versions of Ruby were released in two days. The release coincided with the launch of the Japanese-language \"ruby-list\" mailing list, which was the first mailing list for the new language.",

      "story": "Roman Britain ( or, later, \"\", \"the Britains\") was the area of the island of Great Britain that was governed by the Roman Empire, from 43 to 410\u00a0AD. \n\nJulius Caesar invaded Britain in 55 and 54\u00a0BC as part of his Gallic Wars. The Britons had been overrun or culturally assimilated by other Celtic tribes during the British Iron Age and had been aiding Caesar's enemies. He received tribute, installed a friendly king over the Trinovantes, and returned to Gaul. Planned invasions under Augustus were called off in 34, 27, and 25\u00a0BC. In 40\u00a0AD, Caligula assembled 200,000 men at the Channel, only to have them gather seashells. Three years later, Claudius directed four legions to invade Britain and restore an exiled king over the Atrebates. The Romans defeated the Catuvellauni, and then organized their conquests as the Province of Britain (). By the year 47, the Romans held the lands southeast of the Fosse Way. Control over Wales was delayed by reverses and the effects of Boudica's uprising, but the Romans expanded steadily northward. \n\nUnder the 2nd century emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, two walls were built to defend the Roman province from the Caledonians, whose realms in the Scottish Highlands were never directly controlled. Around 197, the Severan Reforms divided Britain into two provinces: Britannia Superior and Britannia Inferior. During the Diocletian Reforms, at the end of the 3rd century, Britannia was divided into four provinces under the direction of a vicarius, who administered the . A fifth province, Valentia, is attested in the later 4th century. For much of the later period of the Roman occupation, Britannia was subject to barbarian invasions and often came under the control of imperial usurpers and imperial pretenders. The final Roman withdrawal from Britain occurred around 410; the native kingdoms are considered to have formed Sub-Roman Britain after that.",

Propaganda is often associated with material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies and the media can also produce propaganda. \n\nIn the twentieth century, the term propaganda has been associated with a manipulative approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term. A wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages, which changed as new technologies were invented, including paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio shows, TV shows, and websites. \n\nIn a 1929 literary debate with Edward Bernays, Everett Dean Martin argues that, \u201cPropaganda is making puppets of us.

We were all, I think, in different ways affected. Monsieur Feurg\u00e9res alone sat back in his seat like a carved image, his face white and haggard, his deep-set eyes fixed upon vacancy. We felt that he had passed wholly away from the world of present things. He himself was lingering amongst the shadows of that wonderful past, upon which he had only a moment before dropped the curtain. He had told us to ask him questions, but I for my part felt that questions just then were a sacrilege. Arthur, however, seemed to feel nothing of this. It was he who took the lead. \n\n\"Isobel, then,\" he said, \"is the granddaughter of the King of Waldenburg, the only child of his eldest daughter! Her mother was divorced from her husband, Prince of Herrshoff, and afterwards married to you. What about her father?\" \n\n\"He died two years after the divorce was granted,\" Feurg\u00e9res said without turning his head. \"Isobel was hurried away from the Court through the influence of her aunt, the Archduchess of Bristlaw, and sent to a convent in France. It was not intended that she should ever reappear at the Court of Waldenburg.\" \n\n\"Why not?\" \n\n\"The King is very old, and he is the richest man in Europe. Isobel is the daughter of his eldest and favourite child. The Archduchess also has a daughter, and, failing Isobel, she will inherit.\" ",

      "story": "Solar time is a calculation of the passage of time based on the position of the Sun in the sky. The fundamental unit of solar time is the day. Two types of solar time are apparent solar time (sundial time) and mean solar time (clock time). \n\nA tall pole vertically fixed in the ground casts a shadow on any sunny day. At one moment during the day, the shadow will point exactly north or south (or disappear when and if the Sun moves directly overhead). That instant is local apparent noon, or 12:00 local apparent time. About 24 hours later the shadow will again point north/south, the Sun seeming to have covered a 360-degree arc around the Earth's axis. When the Sun has covered exactly 15 degrees (1/24 of a circle, both angles being measured in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis), local apparent time is 13:00 exactly; after 15 more degrees it will be 14:00 exactly. \n\nThe problem is that in September the Sun takes less time (as measured by an accurate clock) to make an apparent revolution than it does in December; 24 \"hours\" of solar time can be 21 seconds less or 29 seconds more than 24 hours of clock time. As explained in the equation of time article, this is due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (i.e. the Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular, meaning that the Earth-Sun distance varies throughout the year), and the fact that the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit (the so-called obliquity of the ecliptic).",

      "story": "Starting in the late 1950s, American computer scientist Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching with the goal to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation, funded by the US Department of Defense. This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System. The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) (NPL) in the late 1960s. Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe in the decade following, including the incorporation of the concept in the early ARPANET in the United States. \n\nPacket switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes. In cases of billable services, such as cellular communication services, circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted, such as characters, packets, or messages.",

The two had grown close when Tomaselli was the teen's summer camp counselor. \n\nSeven of those charges were dropped, Leary said, and Tomaselli pleaded guilty to gross sexual assault, unlawful sexual contact and two counts of visual sexual aggression towards a minor. \n\nTomaselli, 23, had told CNN earlier this month that he planned to plead guilty. \n\n\"I take complete responsibility for what I did,\" he said by phone from Lewiston, Maine. \n\nTomaselli, who is currently out on bail, is the third man to say publicly that Fine molested him. Mike Lang and his stepbrother, Bobby Davis, have also stepped forward to accuse the former men's assistant basketball coach of molesting them over several years. \n\nTomaselli said he and Fine watched pornography together before Fine fondled him in a hotel room in Pittsburgh, where he'd gone to watch a Syracuse game in 2002. He was 13 years old when the alleged abuse occurred. \n\nPolice in Syracuse and Pittsburgh are investigating the allegations and looking for other potential victims, authorities have said. \n\nWhen the allegations first surfaced, Fine -- married with a son and two daughters -- called them \"patently false.\" He has not commented since.

His sister thought it was funny so she recorded it and posted the video online. The video -- and Sam -- became a hit. Only 8 years old at the time, he couldn't have expected the response. \"(The television show) The Doctors called and wanted me on their show so they paid for me to go to California,\" says Sam, now 13, \"and we got to stay in a hotel where all the movie stars stayed.\" During that visit to California, Angie Allred, Sam's mother, had an idea about Sam writing a children's book. Together, she and Sam wrote Opening Hearts, which tells Sam's experience of living with a chronic illness. \"I wrote the book to teach people to be kinder to people,\" Sam says. Moreover, Sam wanted to send pillows to sick children staying in hospitals around the country to make their stay more comfortable, an idea that came from a time when he was in the hospital. \"A few kind boys came in with pillows and they gave me one and it meant a lot to me that someone cared about kids in the hospital,\" says Sam. Angie thought of starting a nonprofit organization to provide a way for people to contribute money to realize Sam's ideas. She named the nonprofit Kindness for Kids. Since then, Sam has taken pillows to children staying at Providence Hospital in Anchorage. Sam's father, Scott Allred, owns a small business that contracts shipping services with FedEx Ground. He asked the company for help. \"FedEx Ground learned about Sam's pillow project,\" says Erin Truxal, manager of public relations for FedEx Ground. \"We thought, 'What a perfect way for us to get involved.'\" The company provided shipping services for Sam to ship about 5,000 pillows to hospitals. Sam wants to send more pillows to all of the children's hospitals in every state. His goal is simple: \"Kids in the hospital as happy as they were before they got sick,\" he says.",

Where are you going?\" \n\n\"I'm going to the empty lot on Maple Street to ride my bike. The other kids are going to be there. Do you want to come?\" \n\n\"Sure,\" said Cindy. \n\nTony and Cindy rode to Maple Street, to the empty lot. The empty lot did not have a house on it. Instead, it had big hills of dirt, and it had trees cut down on the ground. There was a low part that became a pond after it rained. The lot had been empty for a couple of years, because times were bad and the builder couldn't find a buyer for another house. The kids had ridden their bikes over the hills of dirt, around the cut trees, and through the muddy pond. There were bike trails all over the empty lot. There were even places where the kids could jump their bikes. \n\nThere were three other children riding their bikes at the empty lot when Tony and Cindy arrived: Lana, Billy and Chris. \n\nCindy said, \"I am calling my mom to let her know that I'm here.\" \n\nTony said, \"That's a good idea. Can I use your phone when you're done?\" \n\nCindy said \"Sure! Keep it for now. I'm going to go on the jump path. I was scared to try it last time. I don't want to break my phone if I fall. I'm leaving my backpack here, too.\" \n\n\"Okay.\" said Tony. \"I'll watch. You'll do good.\"",

But an early review in The New York Times ensured that the book would be noticed. \"It's as if, in writing it, she broke through the ordinary human condition with all its dissatisfactions, and achieved a kind of transfiguration ,\" wrote Anatole Broyard, with an enthusiasm and amazement that was shared by many critics and readers. The book became a classic, and Robinson was recognized as one of the outstanding American writers of our time. Yet it would be more than twenty years before she wrote another novel. \n\nDuring the period, Robinson devoted herself to writing nonfiction. Her essays and book reviews appeared in Harper's and The New York Times Book Review, and in 1989 she published Mother Country: Britain, the Welfare State, and Nuclear Pollution, criticizing severely the environmental and public health dangers caused by the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in England--and the political and moral corruption . In 1998, Robinson published a collection of her critical and theological writings, The Death of Adam: Essays on Modern Thought, which featured reassessments of such figures as Charles Darwin, John Calvin, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Aside from a single short story--\"Connie Bronson,\" published in The Paris Review in 1986--it wasn't until 2004 that she returned to fiction with the novel Gilead, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize.

Housekeeping is the story of Ruth and her sister Lucille, who are cared for by their eccentric Aunt Sylvie after their mother commits suicide. Robinson writes a lot about how each of the three is changed by their new life together. Gilead is an even more close exploration of personality: the book centres on John Ames, a seventy-seven-year-old pastor who is writing an account of his life and his family history to leave to his young son after he dies. Home borrows characters from Gilead but centers on Ames's friend Reverend Robert Boughton and his troubled son Jack.

And like just about everyone else, they were shaken out of their sleep. \n\n\"It was so frightening,\" Sam wrote. \"The shaking was so huge that I will never go on a ride again.\" Cecilia and Sam wrote about their earthquake experiences. Their reports were later posted on the website. \n\nCecilia, Sam and their parents were staying in an apartment on the 15th floor of a building. They were lucky. Their building stayed standing, because it was built to withstand earthquakes. \n\nNot everyone was as lucky as the Wallace family. More than 800 people died. Many older buildings fell down during the earthquake. \n\nThe damage in Santiago wasn't as bad as in other parts of Chile. So the supermarkets were open for business on the morning of the quake. But it wasn't business as usual. \"The supermarkets have been crazy with people rushing to buy their food for the next while,\" Sam wrote. \n\nNot everyone was able to get money to buy food that morning. So Cecilia and Sam made food bags to _ to people who were begging outside the supermarket. \"We gave some to a kid of my age. I made sure he got cookies and bread.\" Sam and Cecilia's mother wrote that the kids also collected money for the Red Cross. \n\nIt's certainly an experience Cecilia, Sam and their parents will never forget.

      "story": "Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius prosecutor Gerrie Nel wants the South African track star sent for independent psychiatric evaluation, he said Monday, in a move that could delay the athlete's murder trial for a month or more. \n\nA psychiatrist testified Monday that Pistorius has an anxiety disorder stemming from his double amputation as an infant and his unstable parents. \n\nHe's depressed now and feeling guilt from having killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, defense witness Dr. Meryl Vorster said on the stand. \n\nNel responded by comparing the athlete's mental state to post-traumatic stress disorder and saying the law required psychiatric observation. \n\nThe prosecutor's extremely unusual move is essentially an effort to maneuver the court into considering an insanity or \"capacity\" defense even though the athlete's legal team is not mounting one, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. Phelps, a criminologist and law lecturer at the University of Cape Town, said she had never seen this done before. \n\nPistorius' lead defense lawyer, Barry Roux, is fighting back, saying Nel is oversimplifying the law. \n\nThe question was left unresolved when court adjourned for the day. Nel is due to submit his application on Tuesday after both sides have finished questioning Vorster. \n\nThe psychiatrist took the stand Monday morning for the defense, going all the way back to when the disabled sprinter was 11 months old. \n\nPistorius would have experienced the amputation of both of his legs below the knee at that time as a \"traumatic assault\" because he was too young to speak or understand what was happening to him, she said in court.

      "story": "Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- The broadcast antennae for Ivory Coast's state news agency was targeted Saturday night by youths loyal to President-elect Alassane Ouattara, according to his representative to South Africa. \n\nPatrice Mallet told CNN that Ouattara supporters attacked Radiodiffusion-Television-Ivoirienne (RTI), calling it a \"tool\" used by disputed President Laurent Gbagbo \"to spread hate and xenophobia.\" \n\nMallet also accused Gbagbo's armed youth league, known as the Young Patriots, along with armed forces loyal to Gbagbo, of committing \"gross human rights violations\" over the past week and a half during fighting that has left the commercial capital, Abidjan, in an increasingly lawless situation. \n\nPeople have been burned alive or gunned down in public because they are supporters of Ouattara, Mallet said. In November, both incumbent Gbagbo and challenger Ouattara claimed victory in the presidential election run-off. An independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner, but Gbagbo has refused to step aside. \n\nMallet said other rights abuses include using heavy artillery and rocket-launched grenades against protesters, the destruction of mosques, denial of medical care for Ouattara loyalists and the use of rape and sexual assault as a tactic. Gbagbo is also tracking down Ouattara backers on social networks and chat rooms, Mallet said. \n\nThe Young Patriots are run by Charles Ble Goude, Gbagbo's minister of youth. On Friday, he called on Gbagbo supporters to impede the movement of United Nations forces around the country \"by any means.\" \n\nThere have also been clashes between Gbagbo and Ouattara supporters in the central cities, Yamoussoukro and Daoukro, in addition to ongoing fighting in Abidjan.

As they did not immediately see him, he stopped and stood watching them in the shadow for a few minutes. Frank was feeling more cheerful by this time, though his hands were still very sore and, as a good many of the logs were burned on the outside, he was more or less blackened all over. He was getting used to the work, and Jake, who had arrived with the sloop in the meanwhile, relieved him and his companion of the heaviest part of it. Turning around presently at a sound, Frank saw Mr. Oliver smiling at him. \n\n\"If I were as grimy as you I think I'd go in for a swim,\" he said. \"It's hot enough, and there's a nice beach not far away. I dare say Harry will go along with you while Jake and I put up these logs.\" \n\nHarry lost no time in throwing down his handspike, and they set out together down a narrow trail through the woods, which led them out by and by upon a head above the cove in which the sloop lay moored. Standing on the edge of the crag, Frank looked down upon the clear, green water which lapped smooth as oil upon a belt of milk-white shingle and broke into little wisps of foam beneath the gray rocks at the mouth of the cove. Beyond this the sea flashed silver in the sunlight like a great mirror, except where a faint, fitful breeze traced dark blue streaks across it. Dim smudges of islands and headlands broke the gleaming surface here and there, and high above it all was a cold white gleam of eternal snow. ",

Siri isn't welcome on Big Blue's networks. \n\nThe reason? Siri ships everything you say to her to a big data center in Maiden, North Carolina. And the story of what really happens to all of your Siri-launched searches, e-mail messages and inappropriate jokes is a bit of a black box. \n\nIBM CIO Jeanette Horan told MIT's Technology Review this week that her company has banned Siri outright because, according to the magazine, \"The company worries that the spoken queries might be stored somewhere.\" \n\nApple's new 'spaceship' campus: What will the neighbors say? \n\nIt turns out that Horan is right to worry. In fact, Apple's iPhone Software License Agreement spells this out: \"When you use Siri or Dictation, the things you say will be recorded and sent to Apple in order to convert what you say into text,\" Apple says. Siri collects a bunch of other information -- names of people from your address book and other unspecified user data, all to help Siri do a better job. \n\nHow long does Apple store all of this stuff, and who gets a look at it? Well, the company doesn't actually say. Again, from the user agreement: \"By using Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple's and its subsidiaries' and agents' transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input and User Data, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation, and other Apple products and services.\" ",

Yes, because every tournament you guys remind me,\" Woods told reporters on Wednesday ahead of his bid for an eighth title in the event. \n\n\"You play. How I got here was playing golf tournaments and winning golf tournaments.\" \n\nWoods will partner Westwood for the first two rounds in Akron, knowing that his rival has finished second in two majors this year and was runner-up at Firestone behind Vijay Singh in 2008. \n\n\"I've always enjoyed playing with Westy, he's a great guy.

Yet most people have a story about a broken relationship. \n\nFor Jane Black, a six-year friendship ended when her friend was rude to one of her children. \"After quite a few drinks at a party in my house, she said something rude to my child. I ended the friendship face to face at the party,\" she says. \"I didn't realize what I was doing at the time, I was simply standing up for my child, but in her eyes any challenge was a betrayal.\" \n\nWhen Angela Thompson noticed a seven-year friendship disappearing, she let it go. \"I didn't know how to deal with the issue. I didn't sit down for a grown-up conversation; I just walked away quietly.\" The decision caused a reaction among Thompson's other friends. \"The other friends in the circle are the worst people when you are trying to break up with a friend,\" she says. \"They don't want you to stop being friends, because it puts them in a difficult position. You get told to just get it over.\" \n\nThough we have plenty of measures for handling conflict at work or family fight, we still don't have good ways of ending friendships. Do we sit down and properly break up, or just walk away? Psychologist Serena Cauchy has the following advice. \n\nDon't blame. \n\nTalk about your needs and feeling rather than talking like a Dutch uncle. \n\nDo talk about your needs. \n\nTalk about why the friendship is not working for you--about how your needs aren't being met. \n\nDon't gossip. \n\nNegative talk hurts everyone involved and in some cases can make matters worse. \n\nDon't be so accessible. \n\nIf there is a common wish to conclude the friendship, then you can remove it.",

In the painful three months that followed, Sudha met a doctor who had an operation on her leg. So strongly she wanted to go back to dancing after she had been fitted with a man-made leg. Sudha knew that she believed in herself and could realize her dream,so she began her brave journey back to the world of dancing -- learning to balance, bend, stretch,walk, and turn. \n\nAfter every public recital , she might ask her dad about her performance. \"You stillhave a long way to go\" was the answer she used to get in return. In January 1984, Sudha gained popularity again by giving a public recital in Bombay. She performed in such a great manner that it moved everyone to tears and this performance pushed her to the number one position again. That evening when she asked her dad the same question, he didn't say anything. He just touched her feet as a praise. \n\nSudha's comeback was so touching that a film producer decided to make the story into a film,which has moved more and more people. \n\nWhen someone asked Sudha how she had managed to dance again, she said quite simply, \"YOU DON'T NEED FEET TO DANCE.\" Nothing is impossible in this world.

Every morning he would get up and go out to the baseball field, and every night he would dream about his favorite players. He loved the Yankees, and knew he would someday play for them. One day when Tom was practicing at the field, a man in a nice suit came out of a long car and walked over to Tom. The man said that he worked for the Yankees, and was there to see Tom play! Tom was so excited he could scream! Knowing that the man was watching, he played the best game ever that day. When he was done, the man told Tom that he was good enough to play for the Yankees, and to pack his things right away. Tom hurried home as fast as he could, and started to pack up all his clothes. His mom walked in and asked what Tom was doing. \"I'm going to play for the Yankees ma!\" Tom said. Tom's mom was so excited that she took Tom and the whole family out for dinner. Grandpa, Grandma, Mom and Dad were all there, and bought Tom a big cake! As Tom said goodbye to everyone, he couldn't help but feel sad that he would be gone for so long. \"Don't worry son, we'll be at all the games cheering you on!\" said his dad. This made Tom happy again, and as he left to be with his team, he knew that he had finally made it.",

Now I want to give her something special, it must be roses because rose is her favorite.' After hearing it, John says he can help him pay for the rest of the money.

He was determined that his first-born son would follow him into the blacksmith. For this reason, Edward had to leave school at the age of 12,and worked with his father. \n\nHowever, Edward was _ a blacksmith. Although he has an athletic body, he didn't have strong arms like his father, and he felt dizzy in the heat of the smithy. When he tried to find alternative employment, he found it difficult because he had never learnt to read or write. \n\nOne day, he went for an interview at a solictior's office. The job was a runner, taking documents from the office to other offices in the city. The solicitor was pleased to see that Edward was physically fit, but when he discovered that the young man couldn't read or write, he decided against employing him. \"How can you deliver documents to other offices,\" he asked, \"if you can't read the addresses on them?\" \n\nBitterly disappointed, Edward left the building and went to wait for a tram to take him back to the suburb where his father's smithy was. Next to the bus stop, a man was selling newspapers from a stand . \n\n\"Excuse me, son?\" he said. \"Would you look after my stand for a moment?\" \n\nFor the next 20 minutes, Edward sold newspapers, lots of them. When the man came back, he was so delighted with his new assistant's honesty, that he offered him a job. Edward took it immediately. \n\nIn the next few months, the two men progressed from working on newspaper stands to selling newspapers, tobacco,confectionery and other goods in a shop. Then they opened a second shop, and a third. Eventually, they had a chain of 25 shops in three cities. \n\nEdward became very rich, so he employed a tutor to teach him to read and write. The tutor was amazed at what Edward had achieved. \"Imagine what you could do if you'd been able to read and write when you were younger!\" he said. \n\n\"Yes!\" said Edward. \"I could have run myself to exhaustion delivering documents for a solicitor!\"",

Little is known of the first 40 years of his life as only four of his personal letters survive alongside a summary of a speech he delivered in 1628. He became an Independent Puritan after undergoing a religious conversion in the 1630s, taking a generally tolerant view towards the many Protestant sects of his period. He was an intensely religious man, a self-styled Puritan Moses, and he fervently believed that God was guiding his victories. He was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1628 and for Cambridge in the Short (1640) and Long (1640\u20131649) parliaments. He entered the English Civil War on the side of the \"Roundheads\" or Parliamentarians. Nicknamed \"Old Ironsides\", he demonstrated his ability as a commander and was quickly promoted from leading a single cavalry troop to being one of the principal commanders of the New Model Army, playing an important role in the defeat of the royalist forces.",

The app lets deaf people create their own hand signs to communicate with friends. The app now has more than 10,000 deaf users. And Mach thinks there will be about 150,000 more deaf users next year. Mach says, \"I love to create. I will stick to it to the end of my life.\" William Zhou was born in Beijing and grew up in Canada. He strongly wanted to make a change in education. So he created CHALK. It is a group of programs that supports individual teaching and learning. CHALK is now used in 20,000 schools by more than 100,000 users worldwide. Zhou says you have to find something you truly care about. Or you may just end up giving it up. George was born in Tanzania . He learned about renewable energy in Europe and began thinking about using solar energy in Africa. Tanzania is a place with bright sunshine, but more than 90 percent of people have no electricity to use. After graduation, George returned to Tanzania and started his own company, SunSweet Solar. It has found early success in rural areas. George hopes to create jobs and help build his country. He understands the process will take time. \"But I think we are on the right way.\"",

Three windmills were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97. \n\n\"We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,\" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. \"But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must.\" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital. \n\nWith wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power. \n\nNow turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption. \n\nThough considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares. \n\nEach share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. \"There are a lot of things you can do close to people if it's not too big and if there's a model where locals feel involved and get to share in the profit. Knowing that you, or your neighbours, own a technology creates a very different atmosphere than if a multinational owned it,\" says Vad Mathiesen. \n\nGoing green? Yes. Accepted by the population? Yes. Going with centuries-old city architecture? Hardly. \n\nCertainly, the three turbines don't exactly _ the 18th-century city centre, as they are in a neighbourhood 3 km away. According to the mayor's office, none of the remaining 97 turbines will rise in architecturally sensitive areas. But Sascha Haselmayer, CEO of city creation group Citymart, warns, \"With Denmark being a world-leading producer of windmills, there is a risk that the answer to every energy question is windmills.\" \n\n\"We've destroyed mountains and lakes in order to support our lifestyle,\" notes Irena Bauman, an architect and professor at Sheffield University. \"Wind turbines are a sign that we're learning to live with nature.

It offers satellite imagery, street maps, 360\u00b0 panoramic views of streets (Street View), real-time traffic conditions (Google Traffic), and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle (in beta), or public transportation. \n\nGoogle Maps began as a C++ desktop program designed by Lars and Jens Eilstrup Rasmussen at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites, and offers a locator for urban businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map Maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March, 2017. However crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps are not ending as the company announced those features will be transferred to Google's Local Guides programme. \n\nGoogle Maps' satellite view is a \"top-down\" or \"birds eye\" view; most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at , while most other imagery is from satellites. Much of the available satellite imagery is no more than three years old and is updated on a regular basis. Google Maps uses a close variant of the Mercator projection, and therefore cannot accurately show areas around the poles.",

Then she saw that her purse had been stolen too. She called the police to report what had happened. The police officer told her that there had been a lot of cases like this in her neighborhood lately, and they were looking for the criminals. Phoebe went into her bedroom and started to cry. She had no money to buy a new television set or stereo. She was scared that the robbers might try to break into her house again. She called her friend Mary and asked her what to do. Mary told Phoebe to change her front door lock right away. She said she knew a detective who could try to find the robber who had broken into her house.

I will always take a stance on women writing b/c I believe in us!\" Minaj tweeted on July 2. \"I've congratulated Iggy on the success of 'Fancy,' publicly. She should be very proud of that. All the women nominated should b proud. ... That will never change my desire to motivate women to write. Our voices have to be heard. I hope I inspire up & coming females to do that.\" \n\nAzalea initially remained silent on the subject, but by July 3 the rapper had grown tired of the commentary. \n\n\"I have to say the general explosion of pettiness online in the last few days is hard to ignore and honestly ... lame,\" Azalea wrote in a statement, as captured on her Instagram account. \"If I had won the BET award that would've been great but it wasn't my year and I don't mind -- so you shouldn't either.\" ",

The shock sent the _Searchlight_ backward, and when the youth came down he found himself sprawling on the _Flyaway's_ deck, close beside Dan Baxter. \n\n\"Dick Rover!\" gasped the former bully of Putnam Hall. \"So it is your boat that has run into us?\" \n\n\"Baxter, where is Dora Stanhope?\" panted Dick, as soon as he could speak. He was afraid that one or both yachts were going down and that Dora might be drowned. Even in this extreme moment of peril his one thought was for his girl friend. \n\n\"Find out for yourself,\" burst out Baxter, and aimed a blow at Dick's head with his fist. But the blow never reached its mark, for Mumps hauled the bully backward. \n\n\"We've had enough of this--at least, I've had enough,\" said Fenwick, astonishing himself at his own boldness. \"Dick, Dora is in the cabin--no, she's coming up.\" \n\n\"Save me!\" came in a scream from the girl. \n\n\"Oh, Dick, is it really you!\" and she ran right into Dick's arms. \n\nBy this time it was discovered that the two yachts were locked together, the bowsprit of the _Flyaway_ having become entangled in the rigging of the _Searchlight_. Both yachts were badly damaged, but neither sufficiently so as to be in danger of sinking. \n\n\"Back with you!\" came from Arnold Baxter, and fired his shotgun at the police officer. But the rocking of the boats spoiled his aim. Then Sergeant Brown fired, and the elder Baxter went down, shot through the left leg. ",

It may be that the matter on his mind and the business that was toward aroused him; certainly it was none of the sounds that are common to an inn at early morn, for the place was as silent as a tomb. \n\nSome seconds he remained on his back, staring at the whitewashed ceiling and listening to the patter of the rain against his window. Then, as his mind gathered up the threads of recollection, he leapt from his bed and made haste to assume a garment or two. \n\nHe stood a moment at his casement, looking out into the empty courtyard. From a leaden sky the rain was descending in sheets, and the gargoyle at the end of the eaves overhead was discharging a steady column of water into the yard. Caron shivered with the cold of that gloomy February morning, and turned away from the window. A few moments later he was in Tardivet's bedchamber, vigorously shaking the sleeping Captain. \n\n\"Up, Charlot! Awake!\" he roared in the man's ear. \n\n\"What o'clock?\" he asked with a yawn. Then a sudden groan escaped him, and he put his hand to his head. \"Thousand devils!\" he swore, \"what a headache!\" \n\nBut La Boulaye was not there on any mission of sympathy, nor did he waste words in conveying his news. \n\n\"The coach is gone,\" he announced emphatically. \n\n\"Coach? What coach?\" asked the Captain, knitting his brows. \n\n\"What coach?\" echoed La Boulaye testily. \"How many coaches were there? Why, the Bellecour coach; the coach with the treasure.\" ",

The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \"Buenos aires\" can be translated as \"fair winds\" or \"good airs\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \"Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. \n\nThe city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires). Its citizens first elected a chief of government (i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously, the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic.",

Speaking at a space conference at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, robotics expert and co-founder of the BRL, Alan Winfield, identified it as one of a number of advancements that might be useful to space scientists planning future missions. \n\n\"I was speculating that whiskers could provide a planetary rover with the ability to feel its way around,\" he told CNN.

Its capital is Kingston. \n\nNorfolk Island was colonised by East Polynesians but was long unpeopled when it was settled by Great Britain as part of its settlement of Australia from 1788. The island served as a convict penal settlement from 6 March 1788 until 5 May 1855, except for an 11-year hiatus between 15 February 1814 and 6 June 1825, when it lay abandoned.

The wind soon blew itself out, but the day broke cloudy and dripping, and when the little party assembled at breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the change of weather. Nance had been brooding on the scene at the river-side, applying it in various ways to her particular aspirations, and the result, which was hardly to her mind, had taken the colour out of her cheeks. Mr. Archer, too, was somewhat absent, his thoughts were of a mingled strain; and even upon his usually impassive countenance there were betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of exultation, which the girl translated in terms of her own hopes and fears. But Jonathan was the most altered: he was strangely silent, hardly passing a word, and watched Mr. Archer with an eager and furtive eye. It seemed as if the idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more solid shape, and, while it still attracted, somewhat alarmed his imagination. \n\nAt this rate, conversation languished into a silence which was only broken by the gentle and ghostly noises of the rain on the stone roof and about all that field of ruins; and they were all relieved when the note of a man whistling and the sound of approaching footsteps in the grassy court announced a visitor. It was the ostler from the \u2018Green Dragon\u2019 bringing a letter for Mr. Archer. Nance saw her hero\u2019s face contract and then relax again at sight of it; and she thought that she knew why, for the sprawling, gross black characters of the address were easily distinguishable from the fine writing on the former letter that had so much disturbed him. He opened it and began to read; while the ostler sat down to table with a pot of ale, and proceeded to make himself agreeable after his fashion. ",

That they were filed under the copyist's name, not Franklin's, may explain why they were overlooked by historians until now, said a curator at the British Library, where the letters are held. \n\nThe find is reported in the April issue of the William & Mary Quarterly, a journal of early American history and culture. \n\nThe letters are important in large part because they offer a \"wealth of new details\" that affect modern understanding of Franklin, writes Alan Houston, the political science professor who discovered the letters in the spring of 2007. \n\nThey also raise the question of how many other documents remain waiting to be found on Franklin and his life. \n\nHouston, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, discovered the letters on the last day of his last research trip to London, just before the library's closing time. \n\n\"The first item was a letter from Benjamin Franklin to the secretary of the governor of Maryland, and I looked at it and I started to read, and I thought, 'This doesn't look familiar,'\" Houston told CNN. \"I've read everything Franklin ever wrote.\" ",

He knows no more than a baby about anything, and so he turned the cows into Darnel meadow, and never put the hurdle to stop the gap--never thinking they could get down the bank; so the farmer found them in the barley, and if he did not run out against him downright shameful--though Paul up and told him the truth, that 'twas nobody else that did it.' \n\n'What, and turned him off?' \n\n'Well, that's what I want to know,' said Harold, going on with his tea. 'Paul said to me he didn't know how he could stand the like of that--and yet he didn't like to be off--he'd taken a fancy to the place, you see, and there's me, and there's old Caesar--and so he said he wouldn't go unless the farmer sent him off when he came to be paid this evening--and old Skinflint has got him so cheap, I don't think he will.' \n\n'For shame, Harold; don't call names!' \n\n'Well, there he is,' said Alfred, pointing into the farm-yard, towards the hay-loft door. This was over the cow-house in the gable end; and in the dark opening sat Paul, his feet on the top step of the ladder, and Caesar, the yard-dog, lying by his side, his white paws hanging down over the edge, his sharp white muzzle and grey prick ears turned towards his friend, and his eyes casting such appealing looks, that he was getting more of the hunch of bread than probably Paul could well spare.

It looked just the same as on his first visit to the newly married Darties twenty-one years ago. He had chosen the furniture himself, and so completely that no subsequent purchase had ever been able to change the room's atmosphere. Yes, he had founded his sister well, and she had wanted it. Indeed, it said a great deal for Winifred that after all this time with Dartie she remained well-founded. From the first Soames had nosed out Dartie's nature from underneath the plausibility, savoir faire, and good looks which had dazzled Winifred, her mother, and even James, to the extent of permitting the fellow to marry his daughter without bringing anything but shares of no value into settlement. \n\nWinifred, whom he noticed next to the furniture, was sitting at her Buhl bureau with a letter in her hand. She rose and came towards him. Tall as himself, strong in the cheekbones, well tailored, something in her face disturbed Soames. She crumpled the letter in her hand, but seemed to change her mind and held it out to him. He was her lawyer as well as her brother. \n\nSoames read, on Iseeum Club paper, these words: \n\n'You will not get chance to insult in my own again. I am leaving country to-morrow. It's played out. I'm tired of being insulted by you. You've brought on yourself. No self-respecting man can stand it. I shall not ask you for anything again. Good-bye. I took the photograph of the two girls. Give them my love. I don't care what your family say. It's all their doing. I'm going to live new life. 'M.D.' ",

Penguins Mate for Life During the mid-2000s, films like \"Happy Feet\" made penguins all the rage, and young lovers went around spreading the facts like \"penguins mate for life.\" While the idea is sweet, it's not exactly true. Penguins usually stick with their partners through the mating season, but when it's time to mate again, they choose whomever is convenient, not necessarily their old flame. 2. Vincent Van Gogh Cut Off His Entire Ear This is not entirely true. It was not his entire ear - just the tip of the lobe - and some say he didn't even do it. Van Gogh lived with artist Paul Gauguin, who had quite a violent temper, and many believe Gauguin actually did the cutting. Either way, Van Gogh did reportedly send the tip to a prostitute. 3. Napoleon Bonaparte was Short Everyone knows Napoleon Bonaparte was a tiny man - after all, his nickname was \"le Petit Corporal.\" His reputation for being short even inspired the phenomenon known as the \"Napoleon complex.\" In reality, Napoleon stood around 5 feet and 7 inches tall, which was very average back in the day. Many believe his nickname was meant as a term of endearment, not a reference to his height. 4. Ben Franklin Preferred a Turkey to a Bald Eagle The bald eagle is certainly a well-known representation of America, but legend has it that if Ben Franklin had his way, a turkey would have been much better. In reality, Franklin wrote a letter to his daughter mocking the eagle symbol used in a seal by the Society of the Cincinnati, a private military group. He said it looked like a turkey and may as well be one. 5. You Have Five Senses If you remember learning about the senses in elementary school, you know humans possess five: sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste. Most scientists agree, however, that you have more like 10-20 senses, including pain, hunger, thirst, temperature, and more. 6. George Washington had Wooden Teeth George Washington is known for three things: being the first president, chopping down a cherry tree, and having wooden teeth. At least one of these is certainly not true. While Washington did have bad teeth, his dentures were not wooden. 7. Einstein was a Bad Student If you ever made bad grades and pulled the old \"Albert Einstein used to make bad grades\" card with your parents or teachers, you are lucky you got away with it. In reality, Einstein was at the top of his class and mastered calculus when he was barely a teenager. The reputation he developed for being a bad student had more to do with his behavior. He liked to talk back to his teachers.",

      "story": "An antenna (plural antennae or antennas), or aerial, is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa. It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. \n\nTypically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna.",

Some Homes in the Green Forest. \n\nReddy Fox wasted very little time waiting for Peter Rabbit to come out from under that pile of brush where he had hidden at Sammy Jay's warning. After making some terrible threats just to try to frighten Peter, he trotted away to look for some Mice. Peter didn't mind those threats at all. He was used to them. He knew that he was safe where he was, and all he had to do was to stay there until Reddy should be so far away that it would be safe to come out. \n\nJust to pass away the time Peter took a little nap. When he awoke he sat for a few minutes trying to make up his mind where to go and what to do next. From 'way over in the direction of the Old Pasture the voice of Blacky the Crow reached him. Peter pricked up his ears, then chuckled. \n\n\"Reddy Fox has gone back to the Old Pasture and Blacky has discovered him there,\" he thought happily. You see, he understood what Blacky was saying. To you or me Blacky would have been saying simply, \"Caw! Caw!\" But to all the little people of the Green Forest and Green Meadows within hearing he was shouting, \"Fox! Fox!\" \n\n\"I wonder,\" thought Peter, \"where Blacky is nesting this year. Last year his nest was in a tall pine-tree not far from the edge of the Green Forest.

Once I did get that out, a lot of fun came.\" \n\nDuff married Comrie, a former pro hockey player, in 2010 after dating for three years. Their son, Luca, was born in 2012. Duff and Comrie announced their separation in January. \n\nDuff, 26, admits that she's \"nervous\" after being away from music for seven years. Her just-released single, \"Chasing the Sun,\" is from her still-untitled album, which will be her first studio release since 2007's \"Dignity.\" \n\nShe says she first started thinking of new material when she was pregnant with her son. After having the child and taking another year, she was even more anxious. \n\n\"I felt like I was missing a big part of myself,\" she said. \n\nDuff established a successful singing career on the heels of her popular Disney show, \"Lizzie McGuire,\" which aired from 2001 to 2004.

The Secretary-General serves as the chief administrative officer of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations Secretariat, and of the Secretary-General in particular, is laid out by Chapter\u00a0XV (Articles\u00a097 to 101) of the United Nations Charter. \n\nAs of 2017, the Secretary-General is Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, appointed by the General Assembly on 13 October 2016. \n\nThe Secretary-General was envisioned by U.S. President Franklin D.

According to the UN website, their roles are further defined as \"diplomat and advocate, civil servant, and CEO\". Nevertheless, this more abstract description has not prevented the office holders from speaking out and playing important roles on global issues to various degrees. Article\u00a097 under of the United Nations Charter states that the Secretary-General shall be the \"chief administrative officer\" of the Organization, but does not dictate their specific obligations. \n\nResponsibilities of the Secretary-General are further outlined in Articles\u00a098 through 100.

They are also responsible for making an annual report to the General Assembly. According to Article\u00a099, they may notify the Security Council on matters which \"in their opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security\".

KENNEDY PUTS HIS FOOT IN IT. \n\nOne morning, about two weeks after Charley's arrival at Red River, Harry Somerville found himself alone in Mr Kennedy's parlour. The old gentleman himself had just galloped away in the direction of the lower fort, to visit Charley, who was now formally installed there; Kate was busy in the kitchen, giving directions about dinner; and Jacques was away with Redfeather, visiting his numerous friends in the settlement: so that, for the first time since his arrival, Harry found himself at the hour of ten in the morning utterly lone, and with nothing very definite to do. Of course, the two weeks that had elapsed were not without their signs and symptoms, their minor accidents and incidents, in regard to the subject that filled his thoughts. Harry had fifty times been tossed alternately from the height of hope to the depth of despair, from the extreme of felicity to the uttermost verge of sorrow, and he began seriously to reflect, when he remembered his desperate resolution on the first night of his arrival, that if he did not \"do\" he certainly would \"die.\" This was quite a mistake, however, on Harry's part. Nobody ever did _die_ of unrequited love. Doubtless many people have hanged, drowned, and shot themselves because of it; but, generally speaking, if the patient can be kept from maltreating himself long enough, _time_ will prove to be an infallible remedy. O youthful reader, lay this to heart; but, pshaw! why do I waste ink on so hopeless a task? _Every_ one, we suppose, resolves once in a way to _die_ of love; so--die away, my young friends, only make sure that you don't _kill_ yourselves, and I've no fear of the result.

He was charged with first and second degree murder, sexual assault and burglary, said Anchorage Police Sgt. Slawomir Markiewicz.

The wind soon blew itself out, but the day broke cloudy and dripping, and when the little party assembled at breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the change of weather. Nance had been brooding on the scene at the river-side, applying it in various ways to her particular aspirations, and the result, which was hardly to her mind, had taken the colour out of her cheeks. Mr. Archer, too, was somewhat absent, his thoughts were of a mingled strain; and even upon his usually impassive countenance there were betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of exultation, which the girl translated in terms of her own hopes and fears. But Jonathan was the most altered: he was strangely silent, hardly passing a word, and watched Mr. Archer with an eager and furtive eye. It seemed as if the idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more solid shape, and, while it still attracted, somewhat alarmed his imagination. \n\nAt this rate, conversation languished into a silence which was only broken by the gentle and ghostly noises of the rain on the stone roof and about all that field of ruins; and they were all relieved when the note of a man whistling and the sound of approaching footsteps in the grassy court announced a visitor. It was the ostler from the \"Green Dragon\" bringing a letter for Mr. Archer. Nance saw her hero's face contract and then relax again at sight of it; and she thought that she knew why, for the sprawling, gross black characters of the address were easily distinguishable from the fine writing on the former letter that had so much disturbed him. He opened it and began to read; while the ostler sat down to table with a pot of ale, and proceeded to make himself agreeable after his fashion. ",

      "story": "A nonprofit organization (NPO, also known as a non-business entity) is an organization whose purposes are other than making a profit. A nonprofit organization is often dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a particular point of view. In economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends. This is known as the distribution constraint. The decision to adopt a nonprofit legal structure is one that will often have taxation implications, particularly where the nonprofit seeks income tax exemption, charitable status and so on. \n\nThe nonprofit landscape is highly varied, although many people have come to associate NPOs with charitable organizations. Although charities do comprise an often high profile or visible aspect of the sector, there are many other types of nonprofits. Overall, they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving organizations include mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and peak bodies \u2013 organizations that benefit a particular group of people i.e. the members of the organization. Typically, community-serving organizations are focused on providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally: organizations delivering human services programs or projects, aid and development programs, medical research, education and health services, and so on. It could be argued many nonprofits sit across both camps, at least in terms of the impact they make. For example, the grassroots support group that provides a lifeline to those with a particular condition or disease could be deemed to be serving both its members (by directly supporting them) and the broader community (through the provision of a helping service for fellow citizens).",

      "story": "(Health.com) -- Middle-aged men who take steps to improve their heart health by eating better, getting more exercise, or taking cholesterol-lowering drugs may end up improving their sex lives as well, according to a new analysis of existing research. \n\nNearly 1 in 5 men in the U.S. has difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection, a condition known as erectile dysfunction (ED). The new study, which appears this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine, suggests that ED drugs such as Viagra aren't the only solution and aren't always enough to address the problem, says coauthor Dr. Stephen Kopecky, M.D., a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \n\n\"If you do take care of your lifestyle\u2014eating right, exercising, losing weight\u2014you respond much better to the Viagra, the Levitra, the Cialis,\" Kopecky says. By the same token, he adds, if these drugs become less effective \"that should be a sign that...you need to take care of your lifestyle.'\" \n\nHealth.com: 7 ways to treat erectile dysfunction \n\nED is troubling enough by itself, but to make matters worse it's also a known harbinger of heart disease. The arteries in the penis that expand during an erection can become weakened and clogged with cholesterol in the same way as the arteries that surround the heart. This is why ED often shows up three to five years ahead of life-threatening cardiovascular problems such as heart attack or stroke, especially in younger men, Kopecky says. \n\n\"The common denominator is blood flow,\" he explains. \"If you look at a guy in his 40s who has erectile dysfunction and then you compare [him] to another guy in his 40s who doesn't have erectile dysfunction, the guy with ED is about 50 times more likely to have heart disease.\" ",

But does he merit his place as a leadership icon? \n\n\"It's questionable,\" says Prevas. \n\nOn the one hand, Alexander had a capacity for intense focus and was willing to sacrifice friends, family and personal fortunes to reach the top. \n\nBut ambition fueled by a massive ego eventually proved to be Alexander's undoing, Prevas argues. \n\nHaving defeated King Darius III in the Battle of Issus, the Persian king offered the marauding youngster the western half of his Persian Empire in return for his family who had been captured by the Macedonian army. \n\nAlexander's most senior commander, Parmenio, urged his young master to accept Darius's proposal and consolidate his power in the region. \n\nBut Alexander ignored the advice, choosing instead to resume his conquest, capturing the Persian capital of Persepolis before hunting down and killing Darius. \n\nFrom there, Alexander continued eastwards conquering large parts of south central Asia before heading to India. But it was here that Alexander's exhausted army refused to carry on, thus ending his eastern escapade. ",

      "story": "The corridor windows at the Hangzhou Entel Foreign Language School look a bit different from other schools. They are all decorated with beautiful paper cutting art. But they are not just for decoration. They are also to stop birds from flying into windows. Chen Zitong, 14, a Junior 3 student at the school came up with the idea. In early January, she wrote a letter to the headmaster and suggested this. She often saw birds fly into the clean windows and get hurt. After some online research, she found this solution. \"Some people decorated windows with stickers or posters. Then I thought of replacing them with our traditional paper cutting art,\" Chen said. To Chen's surprise, the headmaster took her advice. The school organized a paper cutting art competition. Students' works that got awards were pasted on the corridor windows. In fact, there have been paper cutting art classes since 2011. \"We have classes once a week for a month to teach paper cutting,\" said Fan Ming, an art teacher. The teaching building even has a display wall to show students' works. Through the class, Shi Jiawei, 14, fell in love with the art of paper cutting. \"It's very fun. I can design my own patterns and present interesting things through it,\" she said. She created many works like bears and magpies . Paper cutting also helps students become more patient. Wang Yiyou, 12, was once an active boy. But now, he can carefully design a delicate paper cutting work with scissors and gravers . \"I am so proud that I can make it look perfect,\" he said.

California voters will decide the issue in November. \n\nThe bill now goes to the House of Representatives, where it is also expected to pass. Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, has vowed to sign the measure into law should it reach his desk, his office said. \n\n\"For everyone, it's a vote of conscience,\" said Senate President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat who says he's long supported a repeal. \"We have a majority of legislators in Connecticut in favor of this so that the energies of our criminal justice system can be focused in a more appropriate manner.\" \n\nIn 2009, state lawmakers in both houses tried to pass a similar bill, but were ultimately blocked by then-Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican. \n\nCapital punishment has existed in Connecticut since its colonial days. But the state was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972 when a Supreme Court decision required greater consistency in its application. A moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 court decision upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment. \n\nSince then, Connecticut juries have handed down 15 death sentences. Of those, only one person has actually been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws. \n\nMichael Ross, a convicted serial killer, was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after giving up his appeals.

To say the truth, he was so much attracted by Miss Cleer's appearance that he didn't feel inclined to mention having met her. But he wanted to meet her again for all that, and hoped he would do so. Perhaps Tyrrel might know the family, and ask them round to dine some night. At any rate, society is rare at the Lizard. Sooner or later, he felt sure, he'd knock up against the mysterious stranger somewhere. And that involved the probability of knocking up against the mysterious stranger's beautiful daughter. \n\nNext morning after breakfast, however, he made a vigorous effort to induce Walter Tyrrel to mount the cliff and look at the view from Penmorgan Point toward the Rill and Kynance. It was absurd, he said truly, for the proprietor of such an estate never to have seen the most beautiful spot in it. But Tyrrel was obdurate. On the point of actually mounting the cliff itself he wouldn't yield one jot or tittle. Only, after much persuasion, he consented at last to cross the headland by the fields at the back and come out at the tor above St. Michael's Crag, provided always Eustace would promise he'd neither go near the edge himself nor try to induce his friend to approach it. \n\nSatisfied with this lame compromise--for he really wished his host to enjoy that glorious view--Eustace Le Neve turned up the valley behind the house, with Walter Tyrrel by his side, and after traversing several fields, through gaps in the stone walls, led out his companion at last to the tor on the headland.

Since 1987, it has been one of New Zealand's official languages. It is closely related to Cook Islands M\u0101ori, Tuamotuan, and Tahitian. \n\nA national census undertaken in 2013 reported that about 148,000 people, or 3.7% of the New Zealand population, could hold a conversation in M\u0101ori about everyday things. , 55% of M\u0101ori adults reported some knowledge of the language; of these speakers, 64% use M\u0101ori at home and 50,000 can speak the language \"very well\" or \"well\". \n\nThere was originally no native writing system for M\u0101ori. Missionaries brought the Latin alphabet around 1814, and linguist Samuel Lee worked with chief Hongi Hika to systematize the written language in 1820. The resultant phonetic spellings were remarkably successful. Written M\u0101ori has changed little since then. \n\nThe English word comes from the M\u0101ori language, where it is spelled \"M\u0101ori\". In New Zealand, the M\u0101ori language is commonly referred to as \"Te Reo\" \"the language\", short for \"te reo M\u0101ori\". \n\nThe spelling \"Maori\" (without macron) is standard in English outside New Zealand in both general and linguistic usage. The M\u0101ori-language spelling \"M\u0101ori\" (with macron) has become common in New Zealand English in recent years, particularly in M\u0101ori-specific cultural contexts, although the traditional English spelling is still prevalent in general media and government use.",

He has released some political prisoners. He sent New Year's greetings to Jews in Iran and around the world. He took a phone call from the president of the United States. \n\nDoes any of this portend real change in Iran? \n\nThe case for skepticism is strong. None of the regime has changed in any way. Iran continues to make mischief through the region, most horrifically by supporting the brutal actions of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. As far as anyone can tell, Iran pursues nuclear weapons as determinedly as ever. \n\nRouhani himself is no liberal and no Democrat. An early supporter of the Ayatollah Khomeini, Rouhani held senior positions in the Iranian state during the regime's most vicious period of international terrorism, the early 1990s - the years in which Iranian-backed terrorists carried out assassinations in Berlin and Paris and carried out two terrible bombings of Jewish targets in Buenos Aires, killing 114 people and wounding nearly a thousand more. \n\nAs Iran's chief nuclear negotiator in the 2000s, Rouhani nimbly evaded international efforts to achieve a peaceful end to the country's drive for weapons of mass death. \n\nMore fundamentally, the president of Iran does not govern the country's national security system. The military and the secret police answer to the supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khameini, who has very emphatic geopolitical ideas of his own. Compared with all that, a cheerful tweet and a few words of condemnation of Nazi crimes don't seem much of an offset. ",

No more Spitz,no more trouble.\" Francois started to harness the dogs. He needed a new lead-dog, and decided that Solleks was the best dog that he had. But Buck jumped at Solleks and took his place. \"Look at Buck!\" said Francois,laughing. \"He's killed Spitz,and now he wants to be lead-dog.Go away, Buck!\" He pulled Buck away and tried to harness Solleks again.Solleks was unhappy too. He was frightened of Buck, and when Francois turned his back,Buck took Solleks' place again. Now Francois was angry. \"I'll show you! \" he cried,and went to get a heavy club from the sledge. Buck remembered _ ,and moved away. This time,when Solleks was harnessed as lead-dog,Buck did not try to move in.He kept a few meters away and circled around Francois carefully. But when Francois called him to his old place in front of Dave, Buck refused.He had won his fight with Spitz and he wanted to be lead-dog. For an hour the two men tried to harness him.Buck did not run away,but he did not let them catch him.Finally,Francois sat down,and Perrault looked at his watch.It was getting late. The two men looked at one another and smiled. Francois walked up to Solleks,took off his harness, led him back and harnessed him in his old place.Then he called Buck. All the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was now the one at the front. But Buck did not move. \"Put down the club,\" said Perrault. Francois dropped the club, and immediately Buck came up to the front of the team.Francois harnessed him, and in a minute the sledge was moving. Buck was an excellent leader. He moved and thought quickly and led the other dogs well. A new leader made no difference to Dave and Solleks; they continued to pull hard.But the other dogs had had an easy life when Spitz was leading.They were surprised when Buck made them work hard and punished them for their mistakes. Pike,the second dog,was usually lazy;but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever pulled in his life. The first night in camp Buck fought Joe,another difficult dog,and after that there were no more problems with him.The team started to pull together,and to move faster and faster. \"I've never seen a dog like Buck!\" cried Francois, \"Never! He's worth a thousand dollars. What do you think, Perrault? \" Perrault agreed.They were moving quickly,and covering more ground every day. The snow was good and hard,and no new snow fell.The temperature dropped to 45degC below zero, and didn't change. This time there was more ice on the Thirty Mile River, and they crossed in a day.Some days they ran a hundred kilometers,or even more. They reached Skagway in fourteen days; the fastest time ever.",

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. \n\nThe composition of a genus is determined by a taxonomist. The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera. There are some general practices used, however, including the idea that a newly defined genus should fulfill these three criteria to be descriptively useful: \n\nMoreover, genera should be composed of phylogenetic units of the same kind as other (analogous) genera. \n\nThe term comes from the Latin ' (\"origin; type; group; race\"), a noun form cognate with ' (\"to bear; to give birth to\"). Linnaeus popularized its use in his 1753 \"Species Plantarum\", but the French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656\u20131708) is considered \"the founder of the modern concept of genera\". \n\nThe scientific name of a genus may be called the generic name or generic epithet: it is always capitalized.

They're a state of mind, a mythology we all know in our bones. \n\nKate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio share a happy moment in \"Revolutionary Road.\" \n\nThe myth goes something like this: The suburbs are comfortable, maybe even beautiful, but their serenity is rooted in a friendly American conformity, so that the people who live there have to repress their true selves, which will emerge when they drink too much and have affairs, or rage at each other for their dishonesty, which was all caused in the first place by ... the suburbs. \n\nThe best thing about \"Revolutionary Road,\" a cool-blooded and disquieting adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel about a powerfully unhappy Connecticut couple, is that it doesn't end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. It only begins there. \n\nFrank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are about 30, with two kids, and both believe they can evade the traps of the existence they've chosen. The year is 1955, and Frank has a New York job that bores him, marketing business machines. He takes solace in feeling superior to his work, and also in his midday martinis and occasional dip into the secretarial pool. April, meanwhile, wanted to be an actress, and still feels she's meant for higher things. Watch DiCaprio and Winslet talk about their reunion \u00bb \n\nMoved to reach for something more, April comes up with a plan: She and Frank will sell their home and move to Paris, where she'll work as a government secretary and he will ... find himself. (It's like a '60s fantasy a decade ahead of time.) \"Revolutionary Road\" was directed by Sam Mendes, who made the glibly scathing \"American Beauty,\" only here he wants us to share not just Frank and April's misery but the frail reveries that hold them together.

She felt as if her heedless avowals had been high treason to her husband; and yet Harriet was her elder, and those assurances that as a true woman she was bound to clear up the mystery, made her cheeks burn with shame, and her heart thrill with the determination to vindicate her husband, while the longing to know the face of one who so loved her was freshly awakened. \n\nShe was strongly inclined to tell him all, indeed she knew herself well enough to be aware that half a dozen searching questions would draw out the whole confession of her own communication and Harriet's unworthy suspicions; and humiliating as this would be, she longed for the opportunity. Here, however, she was checked in her meditations by a stumble of her horse, which proved to have lost a shoe. It was necessary to leave the short cut, and make for the nearest forge, and when the mischief was repaired, to ride home by the high road. \n\nShe thus came home much later than had been expected; Jumbo, Molly, and the little girls were all watching for her, and greeted her eagerly. The supper was already on the table for her, and she had only just given Fay and Letty the cakes and comfits she had bought at Brentford for them when Jumbo brought the message that his master hoped that madam, if not too much fatigued, would come to him as soon as her supper was finished.

Firstly, Jay bought a plane ticket and took a trip to Columbus, Ohio, USA, thinking that he would start by working his way across the USA from East to West. On his first day he was inside a church taking photos when he noticed a golden telephone on the wall with a sign that read \"$10,000 per call\". Jay was _ so he asked a priest what the telephone was used for. The priest told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 you could talk to God. Jay thanked the priest and went along his way. Next stop was in Des Moines, and there at a very large church, he saw the same looking golden telephone with the same sign under it. A nearby nun told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 he could talk to God. Jay decided to travel to Australia to see if they had a similar phone. He arrived at Western Australia, and again, in the church he entered, there was the same looking golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read \"40 cents per call.\" Somewhat surprised, Jay asked the priest about the sign. 'Father Brian, I travelled all over the world and I saw this same golden telephone in many churches. I know it is a direct line to Heaven, but in all of them price was $10,000 per call. Why is it so cheap here?' Father Brian smiled and answered, 'My son, you're in Australia now - this is Heaven, so it's only a local call.'",

This was in 1638, and for some time the lodge at Hursley was lent to Mr. Kingswell, Mr. Maijor's father-in-law, who died there in 1639, after which time Mr. Maijor took up his abode there. He seems to have been a shrewd, active man, and a staunch Protestant, for when there was a desire to lease out Cranbury, he, as Lord of the Manor, stipulated that it should be let only to a Protestant of the Church of England, not to a Papist. The neighbourhood of the Welleses at Brambridge probably moved him to make this condition. \n\nThe person who applied for the lease was Dr. John Young, Dean of Winchester, who purchased the copyhold of Cranbury before 1643, and retired thither when he was expelled from his deanery and other preferments in the evil times of the Commonwealth, and there died, leaving his widow in possession. \n\nWhether the lady was molested by Mr. Maijor we do not know. He was no favourite with Richard Morley, who rented the forge in Hursley, the farm of Ratlake and Anvyle, as Ampfield was then spelt, and thought him a severe lord to his copyholders. Morley was born at Hursley, and was sent to school at Baddesley in 1582, the year of the great hailstorm of the nine-inch stones. He kept valuable memoranda, which Mr. Marsh quotes, and died in 1672, when he is registered as:- ",

He was the first Chinese official to referee at a World Cup, when South Korea and Japan hosted the showpiece event in 2002. \n\nPrior to that he had taken charge of matches at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and was twice voted referee of the year by the Asian Football Confederation. \n\nBut the court in the city of Dandong, near the border with North Korea, found that Lu had altered the outcome of seven games that involved four clubs including Shanghai Shenhua, who have just signed former France striker Nicolas Anelka from English club Chelsea. \n\nHuang was convicted of accepting $247,975 from seven separate cases while $31,760 of his personal assets were also confiscated.

      "story": "Buckingham Palace has a history that dates back over 500 years and has changed hands on numerous occasions, however, much of the building that remains standing today is from the original structure built in the early 1700's. \n\nIn the beginning Buckingham Palace was originally known as Buckingham House. However, in 1762 George III liked the house so much that he bought it for 28,000 and renamed it \"The Queen's House\". The reason for this was down to the fact that he bought the house to give to his wife Charlotte. Shortly after he did this, work soon began in order to remodel the house with the help of Sir William Chambers. This trend then continued with the accession of George IV in 1820 when he decided to reconstruct the house but he still used it for the same purpose that his father did. \n\nOne of the biggest physical changes to the house occurred several years later when the king had a change of mind. It was in 1826 that King George IV set about transforming the house into what it is known today, Buckingham Palace. He did this with the help of an architect known as John Nash. \n\nThe work that Nash carried out involved doubling the size of the main block through adding a new suite of rooms on the garden side facing the west. He then faced this with mellow Bath stone, which reflected the French neo-classical influence favored by George IV. Many of the rooms that Nash added still remain pretty much unchanged today. \n\nThe palace as it stands today acts as not only the London residence of Her Majesty the Queen but also the administrative headquarters of the Royal Household. It is in fact one of the few working royal palaces that remain in the world today. The state rooms are extensively used by the Queen as well as members of the royal family as a way of receiving and entertaining guests on state, ceremonial and official occasions.",

Huangwei Yu, which is about 27 kilometers to the northeast of Diaoyu Dao, is the second largest island in the area, with a total area of about 0.91 square kilometers and a highest height of 117 meters. Chiwei Yu, about 110 kilometers to the northeast of Diaoyu Dao, is the easternmost island in the area. It covers an area of about 0.065 square kilometers and stands 75 meters above the sea level. Ancient ancestors in China first discovered and named Diaoyu Dao through their fishing activities on the sea. In China's historical books, Diaoyu Dao is also called Diaoyu Yu or Diaoyu Tai. The earliest historical record of the names of Diaoyu Dao, Chiwei Yu and other places can be found in the book Voyage with a Tail Wind published in 1403. It shows that China had already discovered and named Diaoyu Dao by the 14th and 15th centuries. These historical reports clearly show that Diaoyu Dao and Chiwei Yu belong to China.

Being the son of a famous surfer, Jack naturally has an interest in surfing. Most of his life lessons were learned in the water. At the age of 17, Jack entered the finals of the Pineline Masters---the world's most famous surfing competition. Everyone thought Jack would become a professional surfer like his father. Unluckily, one month later, he had a deadly accident while surfing and was seriously hurt. Life is like a revolving door. When it closes, it also opens. Jack started to practice playing the guitar and write songs when he was staying in hospital. At first, his father thought Jack only did it for fun, but soon he was surprised at the great progress his son had made. When studying in the university, Jack didn't stop practicing his guitar skills. He played the guitar for school parties. He wrote songs and sang for his teachers and friends. They liked his songs. His first music album Brushfire Fairytalescame out in 2001. It was a great success. His second album,On and On, was much like his first one. They were filled with sweet, easy-going songs that everybody liked listening to. Later, Jack had lots of concerts in and out of America. He became popular all over the world. Jack had five albums by 2010 and more than 15 million copies of them were sold. His music doesn't fit into any of the popular music styles like pop, rock, R&B or hip-hop. It is more like fold music, played with a guitar and beautiful voice. When listening to his songs, you feel like lying on the beach enjoying the warm sunshine. Jack is a talent, though he himself says he is only a surfer who loves music. In his songs we can find his secret of success: Whatever happens in our lives, we have to accept it and do the best we can.",

A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information. \n\nRoland Martin says Howard Dean bucked other leaders and insisted on a 50-state Democratic strategy. \n\n(CNN) -- If Sen. Barack Obama is able to prevail over Sen. John McCain on Tuesday, all of those Democrats who ripped Howard Dean's 50-state strategy over the last four years should call the head of the Democratic National Committee and offer a heartfelt apology. \n\nFirst in line should be New York Sen. Charles Schumer, Chicago, Illinois, Rep. Rahm Emanuel and my CNN colleague, political strategist James Carville. \n\nWhen Democrats were in the final stages of winning back Congress in 2006, those three were at odds with Dean, saying he should forget about his pie-in-the-sky plan to have the Democratic Party competitive in all 50 states. \n\nThey reasoned that money spent on get-out-the vote efforts in non-congressional elections was futile, and all the effort should be on reclaiming Congress. \n\nBut Dean resisted their suggestions, weathering repeated calls for him to resign after that election. \n\nDean's insistence on having a Democratic Party that existed in the heartland, and not just California, New York and Massachusetts, was brilliant in that it made clear that the party recognized the rest of America. iReport.com: What would you ask Obama?

It was unclear late Thursday whether the audit would impact plans for his inauguration. \n\nThe audit will take about 30 days and will involve comparing results from voting machines with printed reports and registries containing voters' signatures, Venezuelan constitutional lawyer Jose Vicente Haro told CNN en Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol.

Philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the discoveries of the physical sciences to incorporate more sophisticated notions of physicality than mere ordinary matter, such as: spacetime, physical energies and forces, dark matter, and so on. Thus the term \"physicalism\" is preferred over \"materialism\" by some, while others use the terms as if they are synonymous. \n\nMaterialism belongs to the class of monist ontology. As such, it is different from ontological theories based on dualism or pluralism. For singular explanations of the phenomenal reality, materialism would be in contrast to idealism, neutral monism, and spiritualism. \n\nDespite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many, all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, which are defined in contrast to each other: Idealism, and materialism.[a] The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality, and the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions: \"what does reality consist of?\" and \"how does it originate?\" To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind (ideas) are primary, and matter secondary.

It is a global financial centre and transport hub, with the world's busiest container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta, it sits on the south edge of the estuary of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the East China coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea. \n\nAs a major administrative, shipping and trading city, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and recognition of its favourable port location and economic potential. The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War. The subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a centre of commerce between China and other parts of the world (predominantly Western countries), and became the primary financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. However, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city.",

      "story": "Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol (; \"Royal Madrid Football Club\"), commonly known as Real Madrid, or simply as Real, is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. \n\nFounded on 6 March 1902 as \"Madrid Football Club\", the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. The word \"Real\" is Spanish for \"Royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (\"socios\") have owned and operated the club throughout its history. \n\nThe club was estimated to be worth \u20ac3.24\u00a0billion ($3.65\u00a0billion) in 2015, and in the 2014\u201315 season it was the world's highest-earning football club, with an annual revenue of \u20ac577\u00a0million. The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world. Real Madrid is one of three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably \"El Cl\u00e1sico\" with Barcelona and \"El Derbi\" with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. \n\nReal Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s, winning five consecutive European Cups and reaching the final seven times. This success was replicated in the league, where the club won five times in the space of seven years. This team, which consisted of players such as Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Francisco Gento and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.",

      "story": "Bristol () is a city and county in South West England with a population of 454,200 in 2017. The district has the 10th-largest population in England, while the Bristol metropolitan area is the 12th-largest in the United Kingdom. The city borders North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively. \n\nIron Age hill forts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the rivers Frome and Avon, and around the beginning of the 11th century the settlement was known as Brycgstow (Old English \"the place at the bridge\"). Bristol received a royal charter in 1155 and was historically divided between Gloucestershire and Somerset until 1373, when it became a county of itself. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities after London in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool in the Industrial Revolution. \n\nBristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.",

Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, \"Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry.\" \n\n\"Do not worry,\" said Twinkles. \"I am going to wait here for you until you get back.\" \n\nWith that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. \"Hmm,\" thought Twinkles, \"I wonder where Betsy went off to.\" Twinkles flew off to find her best friend. \n\nSoon, she heard a voice calling from down below. \"Help me! I'm stuck!\" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. \n\n\"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!\" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free. \n\n\"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch. I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck.\" \n\n\"No problem,\" said Twinkles. \"That's what friends are for.\"",

Dwight, seeing Caleb walking along so sadly, his clothes and hair thoroughly drenched, set up a shout, and ran towards him over the bridge. David was of a more quiet and sober turn, and he followed more slowly, but with a face full of surprise and curiosity. \n\nMadam Rachel, too, perceived that her little grandson had been in the brook, and she said, \"Can it be possible that he has disobeyed?\" Then, again, the next thought was, \"Well, if he has, he has been punished for it pretty severely, and so I will treat him kindly.\" \n\nDavid and Dwight came eagerly up, with exclamations, and questions without number. This made poor Caleb feel worse and worse--he wanted to get home as soon as possible, and he could not tell the boys all the story there; and presently Raymond, finding that he could not get by them very well, took him up in his arms, and carried him towards the house, David and Dwight following behind.

The sport's rough for men who shoot hand-reared pheasants, but there's some satisfaction in killing birds that are really wild.\" \n\n\"There is some satisfaction. The game I've shot was certainly wild; in fact, I sometimes took steep chances when I missed. When you get after a bull moose or a cinnamon bear it's prudent to hold straight. Well, I'd sooner my neighbors liked me, but don't mean to keep my land waste for them to play on.\" \n\nBernard nodded. \"You are not afraid of unpopularity?

The tidings, of course, were told to Mr. Caldigate, and were then made known by him to Hester. The old man, though he turned the matter much in his mind,--doubting whether the hopes thus raised would not add to Hester's sorrow should they not ultimately be realised,--decided that he could not keep her in the dark. Her belief could not be changed by any statement which Shand might make. Her faith was so strong that no evidence could shake it,--or confirm it. But there would, no doubt, arise in her mind a hope of liberation if any new evidence against the Australian marriage were to reach her; which hope might so probably be delusive! But he knew her to be strong to endure as well as strong to hope, and therefore he told her at once. Then Mr. Seely returned to Cambridge, and all the facts of Shand's deposition were made known at Folking. 'That will get him out at once, of course,' said Hester, triumphantly, as soon as she heard it. But the Squire was older and more cautious, and still doubted. He explained that Dick Shand was not a man who by his simple word would certainly convince a Secretary of State;--that deceit might be suspected;--that a fraudulent plot would be possible; and that very much care was necessary before a convicted prisoner would be released. \n\n'I am quite sure, from Mr. Seely's manner, that he thinks I have bribed the young man,' said Caldigate.

A member of the Republican Party, he was previously a congressman, ambassador, and Director of Central Intelligence. He is the oldest living former President and Vice President. Previously known as simply \"George Bush\", since 2001, Bush has often been referred to as \"George H. W. Bush\", \"Bush 41\", \"Bush the Elder\", or \"George Bush Senior\" to distinguish him from his eldest son, George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States. \n\nBush was born in Milton, Massachusetts, to Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the U.S. Navy on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest aviator in the U.S. Navy at the time. He served until the end of the war, then attended Yale University. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to West Texas and entered the oil business, becoming a millionaire by the age of 40. Bush became involved in politics soon after founding his own oil company, and he won election to the House of Representatives in 1966. In 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Bush as Ambassador to the United Nations, and in 1973, Bush became the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. The following year, President Gerald Ford appointed Bush as the ambassador to the People's Republic of China, and later reassigned Bush to the position of Director of Central Intelligence. Bush ran for president in 1980 but was defeated in the Republican primary by Ronald Reagan. Reagan chose Bush as his running mate, and Bush became vice president after the Reagan\u2013Bush ticket won the 1980 election. During his eight-year tenure as vice president, Bush headed administration task forces on deregulation and fighting the \"War on Drugs\".",

She already had all the airs of a hostess, receiving the company, shaking her fan, saying that with so many people to attend to she should have no time to dance. She made a long speech about Mr. Townsend's cousin, to whom she administered a tap with her fan before turning away to other cares. Catherine had not understood all that she said; her attention was given to enjoying Marian's ease of manner and flow of ideas, and to looking at the young man, who was remarkably handsome. She had succeeded, however, as she often failed to do when people were presented to her, in catching his name, which appeared to be the same as that of Marian's little stockbroker. Catherine was always agitated by an introduction; it seemed a difficult moment, and she wondered that some people--her new acquaintance at this moment, for instance-- should mind it so little. She wondered what she ought to say, and what would be the consequences of her saying nothing. The consequences at present were very agreeable. Mr. Townsend, leaving her no time for embarrassment, began to talk with an easy smile, as if he had known her for a year. ",

The old butler, Cloudesdale, brought him the news, and Cloudesdale whispered it into his ears with solemn sorrow. Cloudesdale was well aware that Cousin George was no credit to the house of Humblethwaite. And much about the same time the information was brought to Lady Elizabeth by her housekeeper, and to Emily by her own maid. It was by Cloudesdale's orders that George was shown into the small room near the hall; and he told Sir Harry what he had done in a funereal whisper. Lady Altringham had been quite right in her method of ensuring the general delivery of the information about the house. \n\nEmily flew at once to her mother. \"George is here,\" she said. Mrs. Quick, the housekeeper, was at that moment leaving the room. \n\n\"So Quick tells me. What can have brought him, my dear?\" \n\n\"Why should he not come, Mamma?\" \n\n\"Because your papa will not make him welcome to the house. Oh, dear,--he knows that. What are we to do?\" In a few minutes Mrs. Quick came back again. Sir Harry would be much obliged if her ladyship would go to him. Then it was that the sandwiches and sherry were ordered. It was a compromise on the part of Lady Elizabeth between Emily's prayer that some welcome might be shown, and Sir Harry's presumed determination that the banished man should continue to be regarded as banished. \"Take him some kind of refreshment, Quick;--a glass of wine or something, you know.\" Then Mrs. Quick had cut the sandwiches with her own hand, and Cloudesdale had given the sherry. \"He ain't eaten much, but he's made it up with the wine,\" said Cloudesdale, when the tray was brought back again.

The wagon stopped, and then the rear wheels were sent partly down the slope. \n\n\"Pull him up!\" cried Matt. \"Pull him, Andy!\" \n\n\"He won't come!\" gasped Andy, tugging at the bridle with might and main. \n\n\"But he must come! The wagon will go down in another second!\" \n\n\"I can't help it, I can't make him come,\" panted Andy, between his clinched teeth, as he renewed the struggle to bring the wagon up on the level once more. \n\nTying the lines fast, Matt sprang out. He had seen a loose stone of fair size close at hand, and this he now picked up. Running around to the rear of the wagon, he placed it on the sloping ground so that one of the wheels was blocked from further slipping. ",

The neighborhood is a workingclass community. People do not have very much money, and they have limited access to fresh food in markets. \n\nOver the past two years, the farm has attracted volunteers from the community like Marcy Clark. She schools her four children at home. On a recent day she brought them to Eco City Farms for a lesson. Her son Alston Clark thinks his experience is very valuable. \"I like coming out here,\" he says, \"You know, you connect with the earth, where your food comes from. You appreciate the food a little bit more.\" \n\nMargaret Morgan started Eco City Farms. She thinks of it as a place where people can learn to live healthier lives. \"Growing food in a community brings people together,\" she continues, \"Every piece of what we do here is a demonstration to show people everything about how to have an ecofriendly community.\" she says. From the Eco City Farms people come to know that they are not only growing food and raising chickens and bees, but improving the soil with compost made from food waste. \n\nEco City Farms is an experimental operation. The farm gets its power not from the local electricity networks, but from the sun with solar panels. In winter, the green houses use a geothermal system. \n\nVegetables can be grown all year. So once a week, all winter long, neighbors like Chris Moss and her three children bike to the farm to pick up a share of the harvest. \n\n\"I like eating the vegetables,\" says fiveyearold Owen Moss.",

Wild horses can't pull her away from him. I've done my share; it's for Sellers to take an innings, now.\" So he sent this message to New York: \n\n\"Come back. Hire special train.

As it was, he was too miserable to wait any longer; for his last hope--a letter--had failed him. It was fully due to-day; it had not come. Had his father really flung him away? It looked so. It was not like his father, but it surely looked so. His father was a rather tough nut, in truth, but had never been so with his son--still, this implacable silence had a calamitous look. Anyway, Tracy would go to the Towers and --then what? He didn't know; his head was tired out with thinking-- he wouldn't think about what he must do or say--let it all take care of itself.

      "story": "Yesterday I started the Year of Giving, my first day of a year-long journey into exploring the act of giving and the meaning of charity. I chose December 15 as the starting date, which marked three years since my mother died from heart disease. She was one of the most generous people that I have ever known. She always thought of others first and certainly serves as an inspiration to me. \n\nI had a rather busy day yesterday, ironic for someone who is unemployed right now. In the morning I went to the gym, and unsuccessfully got the phone call from the unemployment office for some job searching. Before I knew it, it was noon. I grabbed a quick lunch and rushed down to a meeting. On my way to Connecticut, I wondered if I would see someone that I would feel forced to give my first $10 to. I was running late and decided to do it afterwards. \n\nAfter the meeting I had about half an hour to find the first person of my Year of Giving! I decided to check out Dupont Circle. I had met a guy there named Jerry once and thought he would willingly accept my first $10. He wasn't there, but I did see a man sitting by himself who looked really lonely, so I approached him. Now I had to figure out what I was going to say. I think I said something like, \"Hi, can I sit down here?\" \"I would like to know if I could give you $10?\" He asked me to repeat what I had said. I did, then he looked at me funny, got up and left. \n\nI then started walking south where I spotted a man standing by the bus stop on Connecticut Ave. He appeared to be in his 60s. I don't know what drew me to him, but I thought I would make my second attempt. I was a bit nervous and asked him which bus came by that stop. Then I explained that I was starting a year-long project to give $10 to someone every day and that I wanted to give my $10 for today to him. The gentleman, I later found out that his name was Ed, responded without hesitation that he could not accept my offer and that there were many people more deserving the money than him. This was exactly one of the things that I hoped would happen. People would think of others before themselves!",

We finished eating but when Susan and I went to throw away the lunch bag, I heard a voice ask, \"there isn't any food in that bag, is there?\" It was the homeless man. I didn't know what to say. \"No, I ate it already. \" \"Oh, really? \" was his only answer. He was obviously very hungry. I felt bad for him, but I didn't know what to do. Suddenly Susan said, \"I'll be right back. Please wait for me a minute. \" I watched curiously as she went across to the hot dog stand. Then I realized what she was doing. She bought a hot dog, crossed back, and gave the man the food. When she came back to us, Susan said simply, \"I was just passing on the kindness that someone gave to me. \" That day I learned how _ can go farther than the person you give to. By giving, you teach others how to give also. You never know what happiness a simple act of care will bring.",

Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \"moai\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. \n\nPolynesian people most likely settled on Easter Island sometime between 700 and 1100 CE, and created a thriving and industrious culture as evidenced by the island's numerous enormous stone \"moai\" and other artefacts. However, human activity, the introduction of the Polynesian rat and overpopulation led to gradual deforestation and extinction of natural resources which severely weakened the Rapa Nui civilization. By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population had dropped to 2,000\u20133,000 from an estimated high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier. European diseases and Peruvian slave raiding in the 1860s further reduced the Rapa Nui population, to a low of only 111 inhabitants in 1877. \n\nEaster Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. The nearest inhabited land (around 50 residents in 2013) is Pitcairn Island, away; the nearest town with a population over 500 is Rikitea, on the island of Mangareva, away; the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, away.",

Having fewer choices reduced stress in her life . \" I learned what's really important and what's really worth stressing . I also found that this simplicity exists in other parts of my life .

But he stood unmoved, and, for a single instant, they absolutely faltered. \n\n\"Cowards!\" cried Salem, and he flung himself upon him. The steel descended like a ray of light; but did no harm; for the sailor's heart was beating against the Mowree's before he was aware. \n\nThey both fell to the deck, when the knife was instantly seized, and Bembo secured. \n\n\"For'ard! for'ard with him!\" was again the cry; \"give him a sea-toss!\" \"Overboard with him!\" and he was dragged along the deck, struggling and fighting with tooth and nail. \n\nAll this uproar immediately over the mate's head at last roused him from his drunken nap, and he came staggering on deck. \n\n\"What's this?\" he shouted, running right in among them. \n\n\"It's the Mowree, zur; they are going to murder him, zur,\" here sobbed poor Rope Yarn, crawling close up to him. \n\n\"Avast! avast!\" roared Jermin, making a spring toward Bembo, and dashing two or three of the sailors aside. At this moment the wretch was partly flung over the bulwarks, which shook with his frantic struggles. In vain the doctor and others tried to save him: the men listened to nothing. ",

The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. Although a recommendation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day, it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria (see Easter for the issues which arose).",

Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. \n\nGreenland is the world's largest island (Australia, although larger, is generally considered to be a continental landmass rather than an island). Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. With a population of about 56,480 (2013), it is the least densely populated country in the world. The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry acts as a lifeline for western Greenland, connecting the various cities and settlements. \n\nGreenland has been inhabited off and on for at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada. Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, and Inuit peoples arrived in the 13th century. The Norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th\u00a0century. Soon after their demise, beginning in 1499, the Portuguese briefly explored and claimed the island, naming it \"Terra do Lavrador\" (later applied to Labrador in Canada). In the early 18th century, Scandinavian explorers reached Greenland again. To strengthen trading and power, Denmark-Norway affirmed sovereignty over the island.",

Not a soul was stirring, not a light visible in any window. \n\nThey found that three or four boats were lying by the bank. Leigh chose the smallest of these and, loosening the head rope from the post to which it was fastened, took his place in her with the others.

      "story": "A news agency (French: \"agence de presse\") is an organization that gathers news reports and sells them to subscribing news organizations, such as newspapers, magazines and radio and television broadcasters. A news agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire, or news service. \n\nAlthough there are many news agencies around the world, three global news agencies, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Associated Press (AP) and Reuters, have offices in most countries of the world and cover all areas of information. All three began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers; they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers. Jonathan Fenby explains the philosophy: \n\nTo achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality. Demonstrably correct information is their stock in trade. Traditionally, they report at a reduced level of responsibility, attributing their information to a spokesman, the press, or other sources. They avoid making judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity. Though their founders did not use the word, objectivity is the philosophical basis for their enterprises \u2013 or failing that, widely acceptable neutrality. \n\nOnly a few large newspapers could afford bureaus outside their home city. They relied instead on news agencies, especially Havas (founded 1835) in France and the Associated Press (founded 1846) in the United States. Former Havas employees founded Reuters in 1851 in Britain and Wolff in 1849 in Germany; Havas is now Agence France-Presse (AFP). For international news, the agencies pooled their resources, so that Havas, for example, covered the French Empire, South America and the Balkans and shared the news with the other national agencies. In France the typical contract with Havas provided a provincial newspaper with 1800 lines of telegraphed text daily, for an annual subscription rate of 10,000 francs. Other agencies provided features and fiction for their subscribers.",

However,one autumn,things changed.It began with a tiny disagreement about a horse,which grew into a major difference.The difference led to angry words,followed by weeks of silence between the two brothers. One morning there was a knock on Paul's door.He opened it and saw a builder holding his toolbox.\"I'm looking for a few days'work,\"the builder said.\"Are there any jobs here I could help with?\" \"Yes,\"answered Paul,extremely pleased to see the builder.\"I do have a job for you.Look at that farm across the creek .That's my brother's farm.That creek used to be a grass field,but last week my brother dug a path from the fiver and made the creek.But I'll _ .See that pile of wood?1 want you to build me a fence,two metres tall,so 1 won't need to see him anymore.\" The builder said thoughtfully.\"I think I understand the situation and I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.\" Paul had business in town that day and left the builder to his work.When he returned,the builder had just finished his job.Paul was shocked.Instead of a fence there was a bridge,stretching from one side of the creek to the other. As Paul stood on the bridge,staring in amazement,his younger brother Jason,came across,and took Paul's hand.\"You are a good man to have built this bridge after a11 I've done,\"said Jason. Then,Paul,with tears in his eyes,said to the builder who was packing his bag to go,\"Thank you so much. Please stay.I have much more for you to do.\" \"I'd love to.\"the builder said quietly,\"but,I have many more bridges to build.\"",

Under the partnership, CMB will become the first bricks-and-mortar bank that can offer in-app credit card payments to Didi users. At present, users of Didi can only choose third-party payment solutions like WeChat Payment and Alipay to pay cab fares. \n\nZhao Ju, vice-president of CMB, said the cooperation with Didi was an important step in its mobile Internet finance strategy. \"CMB's mobile payment is going to enter a new chapter by leveraging Didi Kuaidi's vast user base,\" he said. \n\nAccording to a report by China Internet Network Information Center earlier this month, Didi holds 87.2 percent of China's private car hailing market. The company said it has received 1.43 billion car-hailing requests on its platforms in 2015, which means 1.43 billion payments were made via smartphones. \n\nCMB is expected to use Didi to reach the core users of China's mobile payment market. Jean Liu, president of Didi, said many of the expats prefer payment by credit card rather than Alipay or WeChat. \"The new partnership will help improve service quality and customer loyalty,\" she said. The investment makes CMB part of Didi's existing investors, including Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and China Investment Corporation. Both of the companies declined to reveal the actual amount of the investment. \n\nLiu, who showed up on Tuesday for the first time in public after her treatment for breast cancer, said the cooperation with CMB is for the long run and \"the capital investment is only part of it\". \n\nUnder the partnership, CMB and Didi will cooperate on a wide range of initiatives on financial services and online-to-offline cooperation. Apart from the in-app credit card payments, the two companies are going to launch joint credit cards in late February and automobile financing services for Didi's car owners. CMB's branches across China are expected to help Didi recruit more drivers. \n\n\"There is a lot of room for imagination in our partnership,\" Li said, adding in future people may use their CMB credit card reward points to pay for the ride on Didi. \n\nLi Chao, an analyst with iResearch Consulting Group, said the partnership may not significantly boost CMB's mobile payment business. \"Didi has educated the market for three years and its customers have formed the habit of paying by WeChat or Alipay. So I think CMB can only turn a very smart proportion of Didi users into its payment customer,\" he said. \"But the move shows that China's traditional banking industry is finally thinking out of the box and looking for outside partners in Internet finance competition,\" he said. \n\nStatistics from Big-Data Research showed that more than 90 percent of China's 9.3 trillion yuan ($1.41 trillion) worth of third party mobile payment market is donated by Alibaba and Tencent.",

I didn't know exactly what to expect. But it feels better,\" the 21-year-old told the WTA Tour website. \"I'm very happy about the way I felt out there today. I got into the rhythm as the match went on tonight.\" \n\nWho will be the 2012 Australian Open victors? \n\nWozniacki will next play Georgia's 83rd-ranked Anna Tatishvili, who beat Australia's Ashleigh Barty 6-2 7-6 (7-4). \n\nFormer No. 1 Clijsters made a strong start to the defense of her crown with a 7-5 6-1 defeat of Portuguese qualifier Maria Joao Koehler. \n\nThe Belgian 11th seed, who will play France's world No. 98 Stephanie Foretz Gacon in the last 64, showed little sign of the hip injury which forced her out of the Brisbane International 10 days ago. \n\n\"I wanted to go out there and I wanted to start playing,\" the 28-year-old told the tournament's official website. \"I've had that ever since we came to Australia. \n\n\"I had a good off-season where we worked obviously to try to be in good shape for Australia, then you want to put that to the test and play those matches again.\" ",

      "story": "A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product, and is the molecular unit of heredity.:Glossary The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene\u2013environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. \n\nGenes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \"having a gene\" (e.g., \"good genes,\" \"hair colour gene\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene.

Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. \n\nWhich is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. \n\nHaas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, \"Ernst Haas: On Set.\" \n\n\"Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films,\" says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. \n\nAnd the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. \n\nThe photographers \"are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it,\" Jacob said. \n\nSuch distinction is obvious from looking at Haas' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on.

In 1991 she turned her father's famous 1961 recording \"Unforgettable\" into a father-daughter duet. \n\nJanet Jackson said she did the original duet at the request of her brother years ago. \n\n\"I was on the Rhythm Nation tour and Mike actually asked me to do a song with him and I told him no. I didn't want to do it. I felt I hadn't come into my own and I hadn't fully made a name for myself ... and I didn't want to ride anyone's coattails,\" she said. \"And I remember being in the Janet Tour a few good years later and he asked me again if I would do a song with him. And I felt, at that point, I'd carved my own little niche in this world of music and I felt okay, I can do this now and that's how it came about.\" \n\nJackson said that performing the song alongside her brother again isn't difficult. \n\n\"It feels great -- just listening to and hearing his voice,\" she said, adding that on stage she finds herself, \"remembering the experience of recording it.\" ",

The lady told me her name was Helen and she called the restaurant she and her husband were going to have lunch at after her appointment to see if he was waiting for her there.She explained that she thought her husband parked the car in the parking lot and waited for her in the car but she didn't find him there so she returned to see if he entered the medical building,but Ed was not there either.She regretted making her husband park the car alone since some signs of Alzheimer's had happened in his behavior.I asked a few nurses to help look for Ed inside and outside the medical building according to Helen's description.Then I offered to drive Helen to the restaurant to see if Ed was waiting for her there. On arriving at the parking lot of the restaurant,Helen began to search for Ed's car but she failed,which suggested Ed wasn't there.We decided to have a talk with the manager before we returned to the hospital.On our way to the manager's office.I received a call from a nurse,who said they had found Ed.What a relief! But we still needed to go on searching since he forgot where he parked his car! Fortunately, we didn't have much difficulty finding it.

A year-long celebration is planned for Grand Central Terminal, which is usually called Grand Central station, the sixth most-visited place in the world. The huge building has not changed much since it opened in February, 1913. About 750,000 people pass through Grand Central every day. Some just come to look at it, others to visit the stores. But most are there to catch the trains that enter and leave from the station. It is the largest train station in the world. There are 67 train tracks, all of them underground. The main part of the building has large, arched windows, a jeweled four-sided clock and ticket windows. Grand Central has been seen in many movies through the years. Dan Brucker is with the New York Transit Authority, which operates the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the transit authority at Grand Central for 30 years. In all those years, he has not lost his interest in the building. Justin Ferate, a historian, has been giving tours of Grand Central Station for 30 years. He says the station was designed to make travel a pleasure. \"Why people don't run into each other in Grand Central is simple: each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your leg. Each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your arm. Each block of stone is a different color, so it's a checkerboard, based on you.\" A ten-year-long fight against plans to build a huge office building over Grand Central in 1968 helped create the modern preservation movement.

Diagnosed with diabetes , Thomas would need to inject himself with insulin three times a day for the rest of his life or risk nerve damage, blindness, and even death. And if that weren't bad enough, he had no health insurance. After a month of feeling upset, Thomas decided he'd better find a way to fight back. He left Canton, Michigan for New York, got a job waiting tables, nicknamed himself the Diabetic Rockstar , and created diabeticrockstar.com, a free online community for diabetics and their loved ones--a place where over 1,100 people share personal stories, information, and resources. \n\nJason Swencki\"s son, Kody, was diagnosed with type diabetes at six. Father and son visit the online children's forums together most evenings. \"Kody gets so excited, writing to kids from all over,\" says Swencki, one of the site's volunteers. \"They know what he's going through, so he doesn't feel alone.\" Kody is anything but alone: Diabetes is now the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, with 24 million diagnosed cases. And more people are being diagnosed at younger ages. \n\nThese days, Thomas's main focus is his charity, Fight It, which provides medicines and supplies to people--225 to date--who can't afford a diabetic's huge expenses. Fight-it.org has raised about $23,000--in products and in cash. In May, Thomas will hold the first annual Diabetic Rockstar Festival in the Caribbean. \n\nEven with a staff of 22 volunteers, Thomas often devotes up to 50 hours a week to his cause, while still doing his full-time job waiting tables. \"Of the diabetes charities out there, most are putting money into finding a cure,\" says Bentley Gubar one of Rockstar's original members. \"But Christopher is the only person I know saying people need help now.\"",

      "story": "An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated to a high temperature, by passing an electric current through it, until it glows with visible light (incandescence). The hot filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections. \n\nIncandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.",

It was very dark in the forest. There was thick snow on the ground. It was cold, and there were no houses for miles and miles. First I heard the wolves. The noise was terrible! The horses heard them, too. They were frightened and began running faster. Then I saw long, gray forms among the trees, and soon the wolves were near us. They were running very fast, and they didn't seem to get tired like the horses.\" \"What did you do?\" one of Jack's friends asked. \"When the wolves got very near,\" Jack answered, \"I put up my gun and shot the first wolf. The sleigh was moving about, but I hit the animal and killed it. Then all the other wolves stopped and ate it, so our sleigh got away from them for a few minutes.\" \"Then they finished their meal, and I heard them coming again. The moon was shining brightly on the snow now, and after a few minutes I saw them running among the trees once more. They came nearer again, and then I shot another of them, and the others stopped once more to eat it.\" \"The same thing happened again and again, and my horses became more and more tired and ran slower and slower until, after about two hours, only one wolf was still alive and following us.\" \"Wasn't it too fat to run?\" one of his friends asked.",

      "story": "A Chinese actor's divorce from his wife, over her alleged extramarital affair, has social media buzzing, with posts about the subject gaining over five billion views. \n\nWang Baoqiang announced online on Sunday that he was divorcing his wife, Ma Rong, and sacking his agent, Song Zhe. He alleged that his marriage broke down after his wife had an affair with his agent, and that she had also transferred the couple's joint assets. Ma has hit back at Wang, accusing him of abandoning their family. \n\nThe topic has sparked a debate about relationships and divorce. It seems Wang's situation has struck a chord with many - which could explain the number of views, which are high even by Chinese standards. \n\nThe divorce quickly became a top trending topic in China. According to micro blog Sina Weibo, posts with the hashtag \"Wang BaoQiang Divorce\" have been viewed over five billion times. Chinese netizens seem to have rallied around Wang, with topics like \"Wang Don't Cry\" \"Wang We Support You\", quickly trending after news of the divorce spread. Statistics by Weibo showed that 47% of netizens' posts condemned Ma for her affair, saying it had shattered her family. \n\nBut why are they so interested? what is it about this one that's got all of China ruffled up? \n\nSome people feel that this divorce seems to fit a certain trope - of a beautiful but ordinary girl marrying a rich but less good-looking man. It is not uncommon to hear the belief that a couple has to \"match\" at every level - be it in status, or physical appearance - for a relationship to work out. Wang and Ma's split has many people wondering if uneven matches are unlikely to succeed. \n\nA lot of social media discussion has also centred around divorce, and in particular how people can protect themselves. Wang has alleged that his wife transferred and hid some of the couple's assets. They're a wealthy couple - their assets, according to Chinese media, include nine flats, a BMW car and various luxury goods. As a result, people are debating the importance of protecting individual assets, even after marriage.",

After Utash stopped his vehicle to help the boy, he was \"severely beaten\" with \"fists and feet,\" Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement. \n\nAuthorities credited a woman who stepped in as Utash was being attacked with saving his life. \n\nMandi Marie Utash wrote that her father doesn't seem to know what happened to him or why he was in the hospital, but that he is able to wiggle his toes on command and answer yes or no questions. \"These are baby steps,\" she says. \n\nShe wrote that her father \"keeps flashing back to the assault screaming for \"HELP\" and \"PLEASE GET THEM OFF ME.\" \n\n\"This is a long road ahead,\" she said. \"But the end of the road will be worth it.\" \n\nSteven Utash had previously been in a medically induced coma. \n\nJennifer Moreno, a police spokeswoman, told CNN that all of the alleged assailants were African-American and that none are known to be related to the boy or his family. She said the beating was \"a spontaneous response.\" Utash is white. ",

Upon Trent they had left their mark for ever. Every hour of his time in this country he reckoned of great value--yet he had devoted fourteen days to saving the life of John Francis. Such days too--and such nights! They had carried him sometimes in a dead stupor, sometimes a raving madman, along a wild bush-track across rivers and swamps into the town of Garba, where years ago a Congo trader, who had made a fortune, had built a little white-washed hospital! He was safe now, but surely never a man before had walked so near the \"Valley of the Shadow of Death.\" A single moment's vigilance relaxed, a blanket displaced, a dose of brandy forgotten, and Trent might have walked this life a multi-millionaire, a peer, a little god amongst his fellows, freed for ever from all anxiety. But Francis was tended as never a man was tended before. Trent himself had done his share of the carrying, ever keeping his eyes fixed upon the death-lit face of their burden, every ready to fight off the progress of the fever and ague, as the twitching lips or shivering limbs gave warning of a change. For fourteen days he had not slept; until they had reached Garba his clothes had never been changed since they had started upon their perilous journey. As he rode into Attra he reeled a little in his saddle, and he walked into the office of the Agent more like a ghost than a man. ",

She imparted her projects without delay to Lucretia, who received them in a different spirit from that in which they were communicated. Lucretia bore as little resemblance to her step-mother in character, as in person. If she did not possess her beauty, she was born with an intellect of far greater capacity and reach. She had a deep judgment. A hasty alliance with a youth, arranged by their mutual relatives, might suit very well the clime and manners of Italy, but Lucretia was well aware that it was altogether opposed to the habits and feelings of this country. She had no conviction that either Coningsby would wish to marry her, or, if willing, that his grandfather would sanction such a step in one as yet only on the threshold of the world. Lucretia therefore received the suggestions and proposals of Madarne Colonna with coldness and indifference; one might even say contempt, for she neither felt respect for this lady, nor was she sedulous to evince it. Although really younger than Coningsby, Lucretia felt that a woman of eighteen is, in all worldly considerations, ten years older than a youth of the same age. She anticipated that a considerable time might elapse before Coningsby would feel it necessary to seal his destiny by marriage, while, on the other hand, she was not only anxious, but resolved, not to delay on her part her emancipation from the galling position in which she very frequently found herself.

It is all very well to tell a fellow to be as \"big a swell\" as anybody else, as Tom had told him. But Faddle acknowledged to himself the difficulty of acting up to such advice. Even the eyes of Colonel Stubbs turned upon him after receipt of the letter would oppress him. \n\nNevertheless he must do his best, and he took a gig at the station nearest to Albury. He was careful to carry his bag with him, but still he lived in hope that he would be able to return to London the same day. When he found himself within the lodges of Stalham Park he could hardly keep himself from shivering, and, when he asked the footman at the door whether Colonel Stubbs were there, he longed to be told that Colonel Stubbs had gone away on the previous day to some--he did not care what--distant part of the globe. But Colonel Stubbs had not gone away. Colonel Stubbs was in the house. ",

      "story": "Why does most of the world travel on the right side today? Theories differ, but there's no doubt that Napoleon was a major influence. The French had used the right since at least the late 18th century. Some say that before the French Revolution, noblemen drove their carriages on the left, forcing the peasants to the right. Regardless of the origin, Napoleon brought right-hand traffic to the nations he conquered, including Russia, Switzerland and Germany. Hitler, in turn, ordered right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia and Austria in the 1930s. Nations that escaped right-hand control, like Great Britain, followed their left-hand tradition. \n\nThe U.S. has not always been a nation of right-hand rivers; earlier in its history, carriage and horse traffic traveled on the left, as it did in England. But by the late 1700s, people driving large wagons pulled by several pairs of horses began promoting a shift to the right. A driver would sit on the rear left horse in order to wave his whip with his right hand; to see opposite traffic clearly, they traveled on the right. \n\nOne of the final moves to firmly standardize traffic directions in the U.S. occurred in the 20th century, when Henry Ford decided to mass-produce his cars with controls on the left (one reason, stated in 1908; the convenience for passengers exiting directly onto the edge, especially... if there is a lady to be considered). Once these rules were set, many countries eventually adjusted to the right-hand standard, including Canada in the 1920s, Sweden in 1967 and Burma in 1970. The U.K. and former colonies such as Australia and India are among the western world's few remaining holdouts. Several Asian countries, including Japan, use the left as well -- thought many places use both right-hand-drive and left-hand-drive cars.",

Situated on Santa Monica Bay, it is bordered on three sides by the city of Los Angeles \u2013 Pacific Palisades to the north, Brentwood on the northeast, Sawtelle on the east, Mar Vista on the southeast, and Venice on the south. Santa Monica is well known for its affluent single-family neighborhoods but also has many neighborhoods consisting primarily of condominiums and apartments. Over two-thirds of Santa Monica's residents are renters. The Census Bureau population for Santa Monica in 2010 was 89,736. \n\nSanta Monica was long inhabited by the Tongva people. Santa Monica was called Kecheek in the Tongva language. The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portol\u00e0, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769. There are two different versions of the naming of the city. One says that it was named in honor of the feast day of Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine), but her feast day is actually May 4. Another version says that it was named by Juan Cresp\u00ed on account of a pair of springs, the Kuruvungna Springs (Serra Springs), that were reminiscent of the tears that Saint Monica shed over her son's early impiety.",

He earned a little money by serving as a model to artists who could not pay for a professional model. He was a fierce, little, old man who protected the two young women in the studio apartment above him. \n\nSue found Behrman in his room. In one area was a blank canvas that had been waiting twenty-five years for the first line of paint. Sue told him about Johnsy and how she feared that her friend would float away like a leaf on the old ivy vine climbing hopelessly up the outside block wall. \n\nOld Behrman was angered at such an idea. \"Are there people in the world with the foolishness to die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly business come in her brain?\" \n\n\"She is very sick and weak,\" said Sue, \"and the disease has left her mind full of strange ideas.\" \n\n\"This is not any place in which one so good as Miss Johnsy shall lie sick,\" yelled Behrman. \"Some day I will paint a masterpiece, and we shall all go away.\" \n\nJohnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. She and Behrman went into the other room. They looked out a window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other without speaking. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. \n\nThe next morning, Sue awoke after an hour's sleep. She found Johnsy with wide-open eyes staring at the covered window. \"Pull up the shade; I want to see,\" she ordered, quietly. Sue obeyed. \n\nAfter the beating rain and fierce wind that blew through the night, there yet stood against the wall one ivy leaf. It was the last one on the vine.

She can use her fingers to pick up small objects .examine them in detail and do most things that human hands can do Each finger contains a tiny motor capable of squeezing 20 pounds of pinch foree ,.enough to defuse a bomb under the direction of an operator. She sits on a metal base with wheels that let her move around. turn in tight spaces and climb over small objects, . \n\nMike McLoughlin is the main investigator for the Applied Physics Laboratory's Prosthetics Program. \"The purpose of that program is to develop prosthetic arms that have all the capability of your natural arms .and you do all the complex motions that we can do with the natural arm- with the robot. \" \n\nIt was a difficult job. Mr. McLoughlin says the device had to have many small motors to. have the ability to do what a human hand does; It also needs to have human-like strength. The thumb was especially difficult because it permits the hand .to hold objects. And everything had. to fit into a space about the size of a human hand. \n\nThe next problem .he says .was to figure out how to control the artificial hand. \" So we had to figure out how to make the connection between the brain and this arm. \n\nFor search-and-rescue duties.Roho Sally will be operated by a human being using a wire- less machine that is far from the robot. The operator will also wear special gloves and glasses. The glasses permit the operator to see the robot's hands .even though they are far away. \n\nMr. McLoughlin says this kind of robots could be used in what he calls \"dull , dirty or dan- gerous\" situations where fine human finger movements are required.

And Mrs. Houghton herself, though she had given such excellent advice, accompanied him. She was of course anxious to see Lady Susanna, who had always especially disliked her; and Jack himself was desirous of making the acquaintance of a lady who had been, he was assured, sent up to town on purpose to protect the young wife from his wiles. Both Mrs. Houghton and Jack had become very intimate in Munster Court, and there was nothing strange in their dropping in together even before lunch. Jack was of course introduced to Lady Susanna. The two ladies grimaced at each other, each knowing the other's feeling towards herself. Mary having suspected that Lady Susanna had been sent for in reference to this special friend, determined on being specially gracious to Jack. She had already, since Lady Susanna's arrival, told that lady that she was able to manage her own little affairs. Lady Susanna had said an unfortunate word as to the unnecessary expense of four wax candles when they two were sitting alone in the drawing-room. Lady George had said that it was pretty. Lady Susanna had expostulated gravely, and then Lady George had spoken out. \"Dear Susanna, do let me manage my own little affairs.\" Of course the words had rankled, and of course the love which the ladies bore to each other had not been increased. Lady George was now quite resolved to show dear Susanna that she was not afraid of her duenna. ",

The children who slept longer, although they woke up more frequently during the night, scored higher on tests, Sadeh reported in the March/April issue of journal Child Development. \n\n\"When the children slept longer, their sleep quality was somewhat weak, but in spite of this their performance for study improved because the extra sleep was more significant than the reduction in sleep quality. \" Sadeh said. \"Some studies suggested that lack of sleep as a child affects development into adulthood and it's more likely to develop their attention disorder when they grow older. \" \n\nIn earlier studies, Sadeh's team found that fourth graders slept an average of 8. 2 hours and sixth graders slept an average of 7. 7 hours. \n\n\"Previous research has shown children in elementary school need at least nine hours of sleep a night on a regular basis, said Carl Hunt, director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research in Bethesda, and high-school-age children need somewhat less, he said, adding the results of insufficient sleep could be serious. \n\n\"A tired child is an accident waiting to happen,\" Hunt said. \"And as kids get older, toys get bigger and the risks higher. \"Hunt also said too little sleep could result in learning and memory problems and long-term effects on school performance. \n\n\"This is an important extension of what we already know, \" Hunt said of Sadeh's research, adding sleep is as important as nutrition and exercise to good health. \n\n\"To put it into reality,\" Hunt said, \"parents should make sure they know when their children actually are going to sleep and their rooms are conducive to sleeping instead of playing. \"",

      "story": "In real life, the daily struggles between parents and children are around these narrow problems of an extra hour, extra TV show, and so on\" said Avi Sadeh, psychology professor at Tel Aviv University. \"Too little sleep and more accidents,\" he said. \n\nSadeh and his colleagues found an extra hour of sleep can make a big difference. The children who slept longer, although they woke up more frequently during the night, scored higher on tests, Sadeh reported in the March/April issue of journal Child Development. \n\n\"When the children slept longer, their sleep quality was somewhat weak, but in spite of this their performance for study improved because the extra sleep was more significant than the reduction in sleep quality. \" Sadeh said. \"Some studies suggested that lack of sleep as a child affects development into adulthood and it's more likely to develop their attention disorder when they grow older. \" \n\nIn earlier studies, Sadeh's team found that fourth graders slept an average of 8. 2 hours and sixth graders slept an average of 7. 7 hours. \n\n\"Previous research has shown children in elementary school need at least nine hours of sleep a night on a regular basis, said Carl Hunt, director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research in Bethesda, and high-school-age children need somewhat less, he said, adding the results of insufficient sleep could be serious. \n\n\"A tired child is an accident waiting to happen,\" Hunt said. \"And as kids get older, toys get bigger and the risks higher. \"Hunt also said too little sleep could result in learning and memory problems and long-term effects on school performance. \n\n\"This is an important extension of what we already know, \" Hunt said of Sadeh's research, adding sleep is as important as nutrition and exercise to good health. \n\n\"To put it into reality,\" Hunt said, \"parents should make sure they know when their children actually are going to sleep and their rooms are conducive to sleeping instead of playing. \"",

It had been placed there since my last visit, and that same day I pushed Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across the landing and round the other room, which, from that day on, became my regular job. \n\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, my sister's husband; then I explained my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help. But, she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money - or anything but my daily dinner - nor even mentioned that I should be paid for my services. \n\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me; sometimes, she would be seemingly kind to me; sometimes, she would be quite familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, \"Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said yes, Miss Havisham would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would hold her tightly with great fondness, saying something quietly in her ear that sounded like \"Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\"",

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time. \n\nFeynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.",

We crept quietly into our places. Mary waited until she saw her grandmother's gray head bend down, and her grandmother's bushy eyebrows contract attentively, over her reading.

      "story": "(CNN) -- Wednesday night's CNN debate lands at a critical moment in the Republican race. \n\nThis season, each debate has set the tone for the primary to follow. Newt Gingrich's savaging of the media helped propel him to victory in South Carolina. Mitt Romney's savaging of Gingrich helped him to clinch Florida. The current uncertainty about the race, and the extraordinary elasticity in the polls, is partly due to the fact that we haven't had a debate for a whole month. \n\nIt's important, then, for each of the candidates to make a powerful impression in this last confrontation before Arizona and Michigan vote on February 28. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich will compete over who is the most conservative, and Ron Paul will push his unique brand of libertarianism. Same old, same old. But we might see something new from Mitt Romney: a glimmer of humanity. \n\nThe latest CNN/Time/ORC International Poll shows that Santorum is closing the gap on Romney in Arizona, but it's probably in Michigan that he stands the best chance of scoring an upset. A week ago, polls put Santorum as much as 10 points ahead in the Great Lakes State. But now they call it a statistical dead heat between him and Romney. \n\nSo it would serve Santorum well to hit Mitt hard in the debate. This is Rick's natural style -- he gets a thrill out of counting the flaws of his opponents. But Santorum also probably recognizes that the only way he'll win Michigan is by reminding voters of the doubts that they have about Romney's conservatism. That's what he's been doing in the western part of the state all this week, where he has hit out repeatedly at Romney's \"well-oiled weathervane\" stance on issues like abortion and Iran. ",

      "story": "Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. \n\nA feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm\u2014\"in satire, irony is militant\"\u2014but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This \"militant\" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack. \n\nSatire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including internet memes, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics. \n\nThe word satire comes from the Latin word \"satur\" and the subsequent phrase \".\" \"Satur\" meant \"full\" but the juxtaposition with \"lanx\" shifted the meaning to \"miscellany or medley\": the expression \"lanx satura\" literally means \"a full dish of various kinds of fruits.\" \n\nThe word \"satura\" as used by Quintilian, however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed hexameter form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as \"satire\". Quintilian famously said that \"satura,\" that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (\"satura tota nostra est\"). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be Aristophanes' Old Comedy.

Jane would whisper in her ear a secret word, and all of a sudden Samantha would come to life, hopping around, running all over. But Samantha did more than run, she could talk. Jane told Samantha everything, and Samantha understood. One day, Jane was naughty and lied to her mother. Jane's mother put Samantha on top of the refrigerator where Jane could not get to her. Jane was very sad. The one person she told everything to was out of her reach. The next day, Jane had one of the worst days of her life. She needed to tell someone, but Julie wasn't around. She needed Samantha. She had no ladder, chair, or stool to reach her. Julie moved the kitchen table forward towards the refrigerator, and hopped on top. She started to climb up to reach for Samantha, and grabbed her quickly. She came down, dropping Samantha on the floor, and broke Samantha. Jane whispered the secret word, but Samantha didn't awake. Samantha's powers were gone. She couldn't walk, run, talk, or listen. Jane hurt her the one person she could trust the most. Then, Samantha moved, looked at Jane, and a tear came from her eye. Samantha's eyes closed, and she was without life. She cried no more.",

He ought perhaps to take steps; but to take steps would be deplorable. \n\nWithout an open scandal which they could not see their way to recommending, it was difficult to see what steps could be taken. In this impasse, the only thing was to say nothing to Soames, and nothing to each other; in fact, to pass it over. \n\nBy displaying towards Irene a dignified coldness, some impression might be made upon her; but she was seldom now to be seen, and there seemed a slight difficulty in seeking her out on purpose to show her coldness.

VanZile had said, pleasantly, \"Going out to the country for Christmas?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" Cal had lied. \n\nAgain he saw himself as the Dethroned Prince, and remembered that one year ago, sailing for South America to fly with Tony Bean, he had been the lion at a Christmas party on shipboard, while Martin Dockerill, his mechanic, had been a friendly slave. \n\nHe spent most of Christmas Eve alone in his room, turning over old letters, and aviation magazines with pictures of Hawk Ericson, wondering whether he might not go back to that lost world. Josiah Bagby, Jr., son of the eccentric doctor at whose school Carl had learned to fly, was experimenting with hydroaeroplanes and with bomb-dropping devices at Palm Beach, and imploring Carl, as the steadiest pilot in America, to join him. The dully noiseless room echoed the music of a steady motor carrying him out over a blue bay. Carl's own answer to the tempter vision was: \"Rats! I can't very well leave the Touricar now, and I don't know as I've got my flying nerve back yet. Besides, Ruth----\" \n\nAlways he thought of Ruth, uneasy with the desire to be out dancing, laughing, playing with her. He was tormented by a question he had been threshing out for days: Might he permissibly have sent her a Christmas present? ",

Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it is bordered by Tibet Autonomous Region in the north, India in the south, the Sikkim state of India and the Chumbi Valley of Tibet in the west, and Arunachal Pradesh state of India in the east. Bhutan is geopolitically in South Asia and is the region's second least populous nation after the Maldives. Thimphu is its capital and largest city, while Phuntsholing is its financial center. \n\nThe independence of Bhutan has endured for centuries, and the territory was never colonized in its history. Situated on the ancient Silk Road between Tibet, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, the Bhutanese state developed a distinct national identity based on Buddhism. Headed by a spiritual leader known as the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, the territory was composed of many fiefdoms and governed as a Buddhist theocracy. Following a civil war in the 19th century, the House of Wangchuck reunited the country and established relations with the British Empire. Bhutan fostered a strategic partnership with India during the rise of Chinese communism and has a disputed border with the People's Republic of China. In 2008, it transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy and held the first election to the National Assembly of Bhutan, that has a two party system characterizing Bhutanese democracy.",

I took a pair of dark green eyeglasses with me. I explained to him that I was having trouble with my eyes and needed to wear the dark glasses at all times. He believed me. The glasses permitted me to look around the apartment while I seemed only to be talking to him. \n\n\"I paid special attention to a large desk where there were a lot of papers and books. However, I saw nothing suspicious there. After a few minutes, however, I noticed a small shelf over the fireplace. A few postcards and a letter were lying on the shelf. The letter looked very old and dirty. \n\n\"As soon as I saw this letter, I decided it must be the one I was looking for. It must be, even though it was completely different from the one Germont had described. \n\n\"This letter had a large green stamp on it. The address was written in small letters in blue ink. I memorized every detail of the letter while I talked to D'Arcy. Then when he was not looking, I dropped one of my gloves on the floor under my chair. \n\n\"The next morning, I stopped at his apartment to look for my glove. While we were talking, we heard people shouting in the street. D'Arcy went to the window and looked out. Quickly, I stepped to the shelf and put the letter in my pocket. Then I replaced it with a letter that looked exactly like it, which I had made it the night before. \n\n\"The trouble in the street was caused by a man who had almost been run over by a horse and carriage. He was not hurt. And soon the crowd of people went away. When it was over, D'Arcy came away from the window. I said goodbye and left. \n\n\"The man who almost had an accident was one of my servants . I had paid him to create the incident.\" \n\nDupin stopped talking to light his pipe. I did not understand. \"But, Dupin,\" I said, \"why did you go to the trouble of replacing the letter? Why not just take it and leave?\" \n\nDupin smiled. \"D'Arcy is a dangerous man,\" he said. \"And he has many loyal servants.

Munich is also the third largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and the 12th biggest city of the European Union, with a population of around 1.5\u00a0million. The Munich Metropolitan Region is home to 6 million people. \n\nThe city is a major centre of art, advanced technologies, finance, publishing, culture, innovation, education, business, and tourism in Germany and Europe and enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and fourth worldwide according to the 2015 Mercer survey. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute Munich is considered an alpha-world city, . \n\nThe name of the city is derived from the Old/Middle High German term \"Munichen\", meaning \"by the monks\", which in turn is derived from M\u00f6nch (which in the end derives from ancient Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2). It derives from the monks of the Benedictine order, who ran a monastery at the place that was later to become the Old Town of Munich; hence the monk depicted on the city's coat of arms. Munich was first mentioned in 1158. From 1255 the city was seat of the Bavarian Dukes. Black and gold \u2013 the colours of the Holy Roman Empire \u2013 have been the city's official colours since the time of Ludwig the Bavarian, when it was an imperial residence. Following a final reunification of the Wittelsbachian Duchy of Bavaria, previously divided and sub-divided for more than 200 years, the town became the country's sole capital in 1506.",

      "story": "Munich is the capital and the most populated city in the German state of Bavaria, on the banks of River Isar north of the Bavarian Alps. Munich is also the third largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and the 12th biggest city of the European Union, with a population of around 1.5\u00a0million. The Munich Metropolitan Region is home to 6 million people. \n\nThe city is a major centre of art, advanced technologies, finance, publishing, culture, innovation, education, business, and tourism in Germany and Europe and enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and fourth worldwide according to the 2015 Mercer survey. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute Munich is considered an alpha-world city, . \n\nThe name of the city is derived from the Old/Middle High German term \"Munichen\", meaning \"by the monks\", which in turn is derived from M\u00f6nch (which in the end derives from ancient Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2). It derives from the monks of the Benedictine order, who ran a monastery at the place that was later to become the Old Town of Munich; hence the monk depicted on the city's coat of arms. Munich was first mentioned in 1158. From 1255 the city was seat of the Bavarian Dukes. Black and gold \u2013 the colours of the Holy Roman Empire \u2013 have been the city's official colours since the time of Ludwig the Bavarian, when it was an imperial residence. Following a final reunification of the Wittelsbachian Duchy of Bavaria, previously divided and sub-divided for more than 200 years, the town became the country's sole capital in 1506.",

      "story": "In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs\u2014Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen\u2014from New York, purchased 6,642 acres (26.88 km2) of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city. The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.",

His pose was limp and his face was thin, for the fever had shaken him, but he felt his strength coming back. Outside, bare trees shook their branches in a fresh west wind, and a white belt of surf crept across the shining sands in the broad estuary. On the other side, the Welsh hills rose against the sunset in a smooth black line. \n\nMarston felt pleasantly languid and altogether satisfied. Mabel had put a cushion under his head and given him a footstool. It was soothing to be taken care of by one whom one loved, and after the glare of the Caribbean and the gloom of the swamps, the soft colors and changing lights of the English landscape rested his eyes. For all that, they did not wander long from Mabel, who sat close by, quietly pondering. With her yellow hair and delicate pink skin she looked very English, and all that was English had an extra charm for Marston. He liked her thoughtful calm. Mabel was normal; she, so to speak, walked in the light, and the extravagant imaginings he had indulged at the lagoon vanished when she was about. \n\nYet he had been forced to remember much, for Chisholm and Flora had come to hear his story, and he had felt he must make them understand in order to do his comrade justice. Flora's grateful glance and the sparkle in Chisholm's eyes hinted that he had not altogether failed. ",

Suddenly, she saw the lawn mower sitting in the yard. \"Mom,\" she shouted, ''I think I will mow the lawn.\" Her mom ran into the yard and said,\"Oh no, you don't. You're too young to mow the lawn.\" \"I'm fourteen years old and know how to do it,\" Jessie said. \"Besides, it would help Dad out, and he won't have to worry about it over the weekend.\" Mom thought for a while and then decided to let Jessie give it a try. After all, she was home and would _ her. Jessie already knew how to start the lawn mower from watching her dad. Jessie checked the gas to make sure it was full, and put on her gardening gloves to protect her hands. Mom watched from the kitchen window. Jessie really does know how to mow the lawn. She was very careful around the flowers and trees. When she finished, she felt so good, but she was so hot. Mom brought her some ice tea and said, \"You really did a great job. Dad will be very surprised.\" Later that day, Dad came home and said to Jessie's mom, \"You didn't have to mow the lawn. I was going to do it on Saturday. It looks great. Thanks.\" \"I didn't mow it. Jessie did.\" \"Wow, our little girl is growing up!\" Dad told Jessie what a great job she had done. \"It was fun, and I will do it again next week,\" said Jessie. The neighbor next door came by and asked Jessie if she wanted to mow his lawn and make some money. \"Sure!\" said Jessie. Jessie began mowing his lawn.

In the latter 1630s, the Dutch Governor of the neighboring island of Sint Eustatius sent several Dutch families over to colonize the island for the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, refusing to swear allegiance to the English crown, these original Dutch settlers were evicted to St.Maarten by Thomas Morgan and other English pirates that had been convicted to stay on Jamaica, to return within the months and years following. The Netherlands have been in continuous possession of Saba since 1816, after numerous flag changes (British-Dutch-French) during the previous centuries.

It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated as first-class, the other being the state's second-largest city of Lexington. Louisville is the historical seat and, since 2003, the nominal seat of Jefferson County. \n\nLouisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark and is named after King Louis XVI of France, making Louisville one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachian Mountains. Sited beside the Falls of the Ohio, the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, the settlement first grew as a portage site. It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which grew into a system across 13 states. Today, the city is known as the home of the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Fried Chicken, the University of Louisville and its Louisville Cardinals athletic teams, Louisville Slugger baseball bats, and three of Kentucky's six \"Fortune\" 500 companies. Its main airport is also the site of United Parcel Service's worldwide air hub. \n\nSince 2003, Louisville's borders have been the same as those of Jefferson County because of a city-county merger. The official name of this consolidated city-county government is the Louisville/Jefferson\u00a0County Metro\u00a0Government, abbreviated to Louisville\u00a0Metro. Despite the merger and renaming, the term \"Jefferson County\" continues to be used in some contexts in reference to Louisville Metro, particularly including the incorporated cities outside the \"balance\" which make up Louisville proper. The city's total consolidated population as of the 2014 census estimate was 760,026. However, the balance total of 612,780 excludes other incorporated places and semiautonomous towns within the county and is the population listed in most sources and national rankings.",

The network is part of the Big Three television networks. The network is headquartered on Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street in Manhattan, with additional major offices and production facilities in New York City, Los Angeles and Burbank, California. \n\nABC originally launched on October 12, 1943 as a radio network, separated from and serving as the successor to the NBC Blue Network, which had been purchased by Edward J. Noble. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. Leonard Goldenson, who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80% interest in cable sports channel ESPN, the network's parent merged with Capital Cities Communications, owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations. In 1996, most of Capital Cities/ABC's assets were purchased by The Walt Disney Company.",

An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, is done under color of law or involves trading in influence. \n\nForms of corruption vary, but include bribery, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, gombeenism, parochialism patronage, influence peddling, graft, and embezzlement. Corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking, though is not restricted to these activities. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality, is also considered political corruption. \n\nThe activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or ill-defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions. Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually. A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a kleptocracy, literally meaning \"rule by thieves\".",

A VJ(video jockey) is a person who introduces music videos on television. \n\nVJs were first seen on television in the early 1980s when MTV went on the air. As MTV became popular, and the audience for music videos expanded, a variety of other music video channels started broadcasting. In addition to rock music, there were channels for people who had a lot of interest in alternative kinds of music, such as country music, light music, and R&B(rhythm and blues), and all of these channels needed VJs. By the 1990s, international music video channels like Channel V in Asia and VIVA in Europe had started. \n\nThe VJs for the new international stations had to be chosen carefully. Although some VJs did shows that focused on small audiences and showed mostly local content, other VJs presented shows for international viewers. These VJs, and the material they presented, needed to be popular in several different cultures. \n\nOne successful international VJ in Asia is Asha Gill. She is from prefix = st1 /Malaysia, but her parents and grandparents are fromIndia,FranceandEngland. She speaks three languages and has fans across Asia, fromJapanto theUnited Arab Emirates. \n\nAnother VJ who has made a big hit in Asia is Lili.

The actress also talks for Lili, and her shows can be seen in five languages. \n\nWhen asked what makes a good video jockey, many successful VJs have given similar answers.

What they could move out is stashed in a garage, while the family has found a temporary home in a relative's basement. \n\n\"Words kind of escape me,\" said Dull, describing his feeling after later sneaking back toward his home and seeing it under water. \"It's a sense of despair ... and it's maybe a check on some of the things that you hold dear.\" \n\nStuart Collum said he spotted the silver chimney and black roof of his house, where he has lived since 1968, on Saturday -- with the rest of the dwelling under water.

      "story": "Food waste has been a chronic problem for restaurants and grocery stores -- with millions of tons lost along the way as crops are hauled hundreds of miles, stored for weeks in refrigerators and prepared on busy restaurant assembly lines. But the historically high price of products is making it an even bigger drag on the bottom line. \n\nRestaurants, colleges, hospitals and other institutions are compensating for the rising costs of waste in novel ways. Some are tracking their trash with software systems, making food in smaller packages or trying to compost (......) and cut down on trash-hauling costs. \n\n\"We have all come to work with this big elephant in the middle of kitchen, and the elephant is this 'It's okay to waste' belief system,\" said Andrew Shackman, president of LeanPath, a company that helps restaurants cut back food waste. \n\nThe interest in cutting food waste \"has just rocketed in the last six to nine months,\" he said. \n\nRoughly 30 percent of food in the United States goes to waste, costing some $48 billion annually, according to a Stockholm International Water Institute study. A University of Arizona study estimated that 40 to 50 percent of food in the United States is wasted. Wholesale food costs have risen more than 8 percent this year, the biggest jump in decades, according to the National Restaurant Association. \n\nFreshman students at Virginia Tech were surprised this year when the two of the campus' biggest dining halls to find there were no trays. \n\n\"You have to go back and get your dishware and your drink, but it's not that different,\" said Caitlin Mewborn, a freshman. \"It's not a big trouble. You take less food, and you don't eat more than you should.\" \n\nGetting rid of trays has cut food waste by 38 percent at the dining halls, said Denny Cochrane, manager of Virginia Tech's sustainability program. Before the program began, students often grabbed whatever looked good at the buffet , only to find at the table that their eyes were bigger than their stomachs, he said.",

Have you ever wondered what these successful athletes eat to stay in peak shape? \n\nKeri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life Meals, appeared on \"Good Morning America\" today to give you a glimpse into the diets of some top athletes. Some of their meals could surprise you. \n\nCrazy Calorie Count \n\n_ One secret of swimmer Michael Phelps' astonishing performance in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day. \n\nAthletes can eat like this and not gain any weight because their workouts are intense. According to Glassman, Phelps' workouts can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories in a day, and those calories must be replenished in order to train the following day. \n\nSnacking Secrets \n\nSome athletes eat wacky (strange, unusual) foods that they swear improve their performance. Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter and 100-meter world champion, has been making waves for stealing champion sprinter Usain Bolt's thunder on the track during the Olympic trials. Asked about how he gets his stamina, Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day, Glassman said. \n\nJonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem. His solution is honey. When he starts to feel shaky at the gym, he takes swigs of honey to boost his energy, Glassman said. \n\nFoods for Recovery \n\nWhat are the best foods to help the body recover after rigorous (strict) competition? \n\nFor Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, the recovery meal is grilled chicken breasts with Alfredo sauce, whole-grain spaghetti and a salad with lemon juice and olive oil. Lochte, who recently cut out junk food, candy and soda, has undertaken a rigorous strength-training regimen that involves flipping tractor tires, dragging shipyard chains and tossing beer kegs, Glassman said.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- With Walter White dead, fans everywhere are mourning, celebrating, tallying up bets and discussing what just happened. Was the series finale of \"Breaking Bad\" satisfying? Did it tie up all loose ends? Did the character you wanted to live survive and did the ones you wanted to die get their just deserts? Is it sending you back to the beginning to binge watch it all over again? \n\nJust when it seemed Walt was heading out of his New Hampshire hideaway to exact revenge on Elliot and Gretchen Schwartz (for dismissing his involvement with Gray Matter Technologies in the episode previous), he pulled the first of several surprises of the evening. Instead of threatening to kill them outright, he asks them to set up a trust fund so that his children would benefit from the money he'd illegally amassed (presumably the goal of his entire meth enterprise to begin with). \n\nGretchen and Elliott of course are terrified by his sudden appearance in their ritzy new home, but had they been paying attention, they would have seen Walt waltz on in. His entrance is a bit ironic, considering their wealth and legitimacy is in some way a result of his earlier contributions. He's always been there, in the shadows, whether they acknowledged him or not. \n\nBryan Cranston, man of the moment \n\nWalt wants them to \"make it right,\" but of course, he knows he can't trust them to take care of his kids on a handshake alone, so he brought backup -- two \"hitmen\" who shine sniper-style red lights on the Schwartzes to lend credibility to Walt's threat that if for any reason his children don't receive the money, \"a kind of countdown begins,\" in which they would be killed. It's a bluff, but they don't know that, so it's a win-win. Walt's children will get the money in a semi-legal fashion, and no one will actually die in the process. ",

Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\"sunnah\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\"hadith\"). \"Muslim\" is an Arabic word meaning \"one who submits (to Allah)\". \n\nThe beliefs of Muslims include: that God is eternal, transcendent and absolutely one (\"tawhid\" or monotheism); that God is incomparable, self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including Abraham, Moses, Ishmael and Jesus; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time (\"tahrif\") and that the Qur'an is the final unaltered revelation from God (The Final Testament). \n\nThe religious practices of Muslims are enumerated in the Five Pillars of Islam: the declaration of faith (\"shahadah\"), daily prayers (\"salat\"), fasting during the month of Ramadan (\"sawm\"), almsgiving (\"zakat\"), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (\"hajj\") at least once in a lifetime. \n\nTo become a Muslim and to convert to Islam is essential to utter the \"Shahada\", one of the Five Pillars of Islam, a declaration of faith and trust that professes that there is only one God \"(Allah)\" and that Muhammad is God's messenger.

The Canadian Hot 100 was launched on the issue dated June 16, 2007, and is currently the standard record chart in Canada; a new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by \"Billboard\" on Tuesdays. \n\nThe chart is similar to \"Billboard\"s US-based Hot 100 in that it combines physical and digital sales as measured by Nielsen SoundScan, streaming activity data provided by online music sources, and radio airplay as measured by Nielsen BDS. Canada's airplay chart is the result of monitoring more than 100 stations representing rock, country, adult contemporary and Top 40 genres. \n\nThe first number-one song of the Canadian Hot 100 was \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna featuring Jay-Z on June 16, 2007. As of the issue for the week ending October 7, 2017, the Canadian Hot 100 has had 117 different number-one hits. The current number-one is \"Rockstar\" by Post Malone featuring 21 Savage. \n\nThe chart was made available for the first time via \"Billboard\" online services on June 7, 2007 (issue dated June 16, 2007). With this launch, it marked the first time that \"Billboard\" created a Hot 100 chart for a country outside the United States. \"Billboard\" charts manager Geoff Mayfield announced the premiere of the chart, explaining \"the new \"Billboard\" Canadian Hot 100 will serve as the definitive measure of Canada's most popular songs, continuing our magazine's longstanding tradition of using the most comprehensive resources available to provide the world's most authoritative music charts.\" The \"Billboard\" Canadian Hot 100 is managed by Paul Tuch, director of Canadian operations for Nielsen BDS, in consultation with Silvio Pietroluongo, \"Billboard\"s associate director of charts and manager of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.",

'I have not gone down-stairs; that is for to-morrow.' \n\n'What would M. le Baron say if his chirurgeon took him not merely down-stairs, but up on flight at the Louvre?' \n\n'Ha!' cried Berenger; 'to the King?' \n\n'It is well-nigh the last chance, Monsieur; the Queen-mother and all her suite are occupied with services and sermons this week; and next week private access to the King will be far more difficult. I have waited as long as I could that you might gain strength to support the fatigue.' \n\n'Hope cancels fatigue,' said Berenger, already at the other end of the room searching for his long-disused cloak, sword, gloves, hat, and mask. \n\n'Not the sword,' said Pare, 'so please you. M. le Baron must condescend to obtain entrance as my assistant--the plain black doublet--yes, that is admirable; but I did not know that Monsieur was so tall,' he added, in some consternation, as, for the first time, he saw his patient standing up at his full height--unusual even in England, and more so in France. Indeed, Berenger had grown during his year of illness, and being, of course, extremely thin, looked all the taller, so as to be a very inconvenient subject to smuggle into to palace unobserved. ",

      "story": "Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6. \n\nThough Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including \"Practical Extraction and Reporting Language\". Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another. \n\nThe Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities. \n\nIn addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed \"the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages\" because of its flexibility and power, and also its ugliness. In 1998, it was also referred to as the \"duct tape that holds the Internet together\", in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.",

The same post had brought him a note from his organist; and that 'stupid old Dean' as he irreverently called him, had maliciously demanded 'How beautiful are the feet,' with the chorus following, and nobody in the choir was available to execute the solo but Lance. He had sung it once or twice before; and if he had the music, and would practise at home, he need only come up by the earliest train on the Epiphany morning; if not, he must arrive in time for a practice on the 5th; he would be wanted at both the festival and Sunday services, but might return as early as he pleased on Monday the 9th. \n\nLance did not receive the summons in an exemplary spirit. It is not certain that he did not bite it. He rolled on the floor, and contorted himself in convulsions of vexation; he 'bothered' the Dean, he 'bothered' the Precentor, he 'bothered' the Organist, he 'bothered' Shapcote's sore throat, he 'bothered' Harewood's wool- gathering wits, he 'bothered' his own voice, and thereby caused Clement to rebuke him for foolish murmurs instead of joy in his gift.

The principality is a constitutional monarchy headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein. \n\nLiechtenstein is bordered by Switzerland to the west and south and Austria to the east and north. It has an area of just over , the fourth-smallest in Europe, and an estimated population of 37,000. Divided into 11 municipalities, its capital is Vaduz and its largest municipality is Schaan. \n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity, and the highest when not adjusted by purchasing power parity. The unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the world at 1.5%. Liechtenstein has been known in the past as a billionaire tax haven; however, it is no longer on any blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries (see taxation section). \n\nAn alpine country, Liechtenstein is mainly mountainous, making it a winter sport destination. Many cultivated fields and small farms are found both in the south (Oberland, \"upper land\") and north (Unterland, \"lower land\"). The country has a strong financial sector centered in Vaduz. Liechtenstein is a member of the United Nations, European Free Trade Association, and the Council of Europe, and while not being a member of the European Union, the country participates in both the Schengen Area and European Economic Area. It also has a customs union and a monetary union with Switzerland.",

      "story": "The 1936 Summer Olympics (German: \"Olympische Sommerspiele 1936\"), officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event that was held in 1936 in Berlin, Germany. Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona, Spain, on 26 April 1931, at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona (two years before the Nazis came to power). It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games. \n\nTo outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932, Adolf Hitler had built a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium, six gymnasiums, and many other smaller arenas. The games were the first to be televised, and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million. Her film, titled \"Olympia\", pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports. \n\nReich Chancellor Adolf Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism, and the official Nazi party paper, the \"V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter\", wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games. When threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations, Hitler appeared to allow athletes of other ethnicities from other countries to participate. However German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods and Jewish athletes from other countries (notably the US) seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi government.",

Of course, Mum and Dad are coming up from England and I've managed to persuade our other sister, Marie, to come over from Australia. She's bringing her kids with her, too. After the party we're going to have another one on Saturday! Well, not really a party. We're inviting the family and close friends (that includes you) for a meal at the house. If the weather is nice, we'd like to have a barbecue in the garden. Julie's going to make a special cake for Suzie. Anyway, we hope to make it a really special weekend for Suzie.

As you can imagine this left Lucy feeling pretty lonely so she spent a lot of time flying around to all the different areas to find other ladybugs like her. She loved to feel the wind in her wings as she flew. She spent so much of her time flying around so she could fly longer and faster than another other lady bug. She also loved flying so much because it gave her a feeling of being free. One day when she was flying around she heard a loud scream for help! She went as fast as she could towards the screams for help. She saw another lady bug with a broken wing lying on the ground. She knew the lady bug as Jessie. \"What happened?!\" asked Lucy. \"I crashed into the tree flying home yesterday and I've been lost ever since. I can't fly because my wing is broken. Do you know the way back home?\" asked Jessie \"Don't worry Jessie, I know this area like the back of my wing I'll lead you home!\" Lucy said happily. \"Thank you so much!\" Jessie said happily. Lucy led Jessie straight home where he was given medicine to fix his broken wing. She was rewarded a medal and called a hero. As she enjoyed her medal she knew she didn't need to find for any more ladybugs that looked like her. She now knew that even with her different colors, she was still a lady bug like everyone else.",

Yale. \n\nThat was the selection made Wednesday by Kwasi Enin, the New York high school student accepted by the eight Ivy League schools -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell. \n\nHe made his pick in style, staging a news conference in the gym of William Floyd High School and delivering the big announcement before teachers and members of the media. \n\nA visit to the New Haven, Connecticut, campus helped him decide. \n\n\"My Bull Dog Days experience last week was incredible,\" he said. \"I met geniuses from all across the world. And everyone there was so friendly and inviting. ... And I believe that their deep appreciation and love for music, like I have, was very critical for me deciding to go there.\" \n\nHis father, Ebenezer, thanked all those at the high school who encouraged his son. \"We are grateful for all the inspiration,\" he said. \n\n\"People think Kwasi is like an angel or somebody who was sheltered. Really, we gave him a lot of freedom, even though at the same time we were very strict with him in terms of academics and the way he behaved. ... We only pray that going forward he will stay focused and not be distracted.\" \n\nReferring to Kwasi's 14-year-old sister, Adwoa, their father said: \"I told her, Look, I believe you can do better than him.\" \n\nEnin scored 2250 out of a possible 2400 on his SAT, placing him in the 98th percentile across the country, according to The College Board. He's also ranked 11th in his class at William Floyd High School, a public school on Long Island, according to his principal, Barbara Butler. ",

In a religious sense, the Islamic Ummah refers to those who adhere to the teachings of Islam, referred to as Muslims. In a cultural sense, the Muslim Ummah refers to Islamic civilization, exclusive of non-Muslims living in that civilization. In a modern geopolitical sense, the term \"Islamic Nation\" usually refers collectively to Muslim-majority countries, states, districts, or towns. \n\nThe Islamic Golden Age coincided with the Middle Ages in the Muslim world, starting with the rise of Islam and establishment of the first Islamic state in 622. The end of the age is variously given as 1258 with the Mongolian Sack of Baghdad, or 1492 with the completion of the Christian Reconquista of the Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus, Iberian Peninsula. During the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun ar-Rashid (786 to 809), the legendary House of Wisdom was inaugurated in Baghdad where scholars from various parts of the world sought to translate and gather all the known world's knowledge into Arabic. The Abbasids were influenced by the Quranic injunctions and hadiths, such as \"the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr,\" that stressed the value of knowledge. The major Islamic capital cities of Baghdad, Cairo, and C\u00f3rdoba became the main intellectual centers for science, philosophy, medicine, and education. During this period, the Muslim world was a collection of cultures; they drew together and advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient Greek, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Indian, Egyptian, and Phoenician civilizations.",

It is owned by Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd., a division of Star Media Group, a subsidiary of Torstar Corporation. \n\nThe \"Star\" (originally known as the \"Evening Star\" and then the \"Toronto Daily Star\") was created in 1892 by striking \"Toronto News\" printers and writers, led by future Mayor of Toronto and social reformer Horatio Clarence Hocken, who became the newspaper's founder, along with another future mayor, Jimmy Simpson. \n\n\"The Star\" was first printed on \"Toronto World\" presses, and at its formation \"The World\" owned a 51% interest in it as a .

It was after this trip that he began to dream about sailing around the world. \n\nJesse's family played an important role. \"I was made to believe I could do anything.\" he says. Although, he says, there were others that were not so encouraging or supportive, \"People that I looked up to, respected and trusted told me I couldn't. Thankfully, I trusted myself. There were people that said that the boat couldn't be ready by the time I had to leave.\" However, through perseverance and belief in himself he was able to do what many told him was impossible. \n\nOn Oct.31, 1999, more than 10 months after he set sail, Jesse Martin went down in history as the youngest person to sail around the world alone, nonstop and unassisted.",

The main character in My Left Foot, based on the real story of cerebral palsy sufferer Christy Brown, can barely move his mouth to speak, but by controlling his left foot, he's able to express himself as an artist and poet. For his moving performance of Brown, Daniel Lewis won his first Academy Award for best actor. Shine (1996) Do you have a talent you're afraid to share with the world? David Helfgott seemed meant from childhood to be \"one of the truly great pianists,\" but the pressures of performing (and pleasing his father) resulted in a complete breakdown. Ten years in a mental institution didn't weaken Helfgott's musical gift: When he was rediscovered, he was playing concertos in a bar. Shine received s even Oscar nominations , and Geoffrey Rush won best actor for his performance of Helfgott. Life Is Beautiful (1997) Nothing's more powerful than the love between a parent and a child. In this heartbreaking Italian film, a father (Roberto Benigni) makes an unbelievable sacrifice for his 4-year-old son: trapped in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, the Jewish man convinces his boy that they are playing a complicated game. He manages to spare him the horror of the terrible war, and even in his final moments of life, keeps his son smiling and hopeful. Benigni won the best actor Oscar. Stand and Deliver (1988) Few people can inspire us more than a good teacher. Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos got Oscar nomination for best actor) is a great one. Employed at a high school where kids are expected to fail, Escalante challenges his math students to struggle for better things, like getting good grades in the AP exam. Despite the obstacles in their lives, the classmates accomplish their goals, thanks to Mr. Escalante's support. The real Jaime Escalante, the Best Teacher in America, says that Stand and Deliver is \" 90% truth, 10% drama.\"",

He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived. \n\nStewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, \"Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?\" Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. \"You can talk!\" he shouted. \"Yes,\" said the bug. \"Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!\" Stewart felt sad. \"Gee,\" he cried. \"That sounds terrible!\" \n\nStewart thought about the problem. \"Perhaps you can stay at my house,\" he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, \"Oh, that would be wonderful!\" The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep. \n\nThe next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. \"Thank you for letting me sleep here last night,\" said the butterfly. It was the bug! \"I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I won't forget your kindness.\" After speaking, the butterfly flew away.

      "story": "In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values \"true\" and \"false\", usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively. Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers, and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction \"and\" denoted as \u2227, the disjunction \"or\" denoted as \u2228, and the negation \"not\" denoted as \u00ac. It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same way that ordinary algebra describes numeric relations. \n\nBoolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in his first book \"The Mathematical Analysis of Logic\" (1847), and set forth more fully in his \"An Investigation of the Laws of Thought\" (1854). According to Huntington, the term \"Boolean algebra\" was first suggested by Sheffer in 1913. \n\nBoolean algebra has been fundamental in the development of digital electronics, and is provided for in all modern programming languages. It is also used in set theory and statistics. \n\nBoole's algebra predated the modern developments in abstract algebra and mathematical logic; it is however seen as connected to the origins of both fields. In an abstract setting, Boolean algebra was perfected in the late 19th century by Jevons, Schr\u00f6der, Huntington, and others until it reached the modern conception of an (abstract) mathematical structure. For example, the empirical observation that one can manipulate expressions in the algebra of sets by translating them into expressions in Boole's algebra is explained in modern terms by saying that the algebra of sets is \"a\" Boolean algebra (note the indefinite article). In fact, M. H. Stone proved in 1936 that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets.",

Some key information about him: \n\n\u2022 He comes from a clique known as \"princelings,\" sons and daughters of revolutionary veterans. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a revolutionary hero who was banished during the Cultural Revolution. \n\n\u2022 When his father was in limbo, Xi spent time as a teenager doing manual labor in China's countryside and went on to become a local party chief. \n\n\u2022 He holds chemical engineering and law degrees from the prestigious Tsinghua University, the alma mater of Hu and other senior leaders. \n\n\u2022 He served in the People's Liberation Army as an officer in the General Office Department and assistant to the chief of the policy-making Central Military Commission.

We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it. \n\nWe piled everyone into the car-my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and me. I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat, but they said no. I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip. \n\nWhen we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play. I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad. After we had found a spot, they let me go play in the water. \n\nIt felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day. As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home. \n\nWhen I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle. We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels. When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture, but then the dog ran it over and smashed it. I was about to yell at the dog, but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home. \n\nWhen we got home I was wiped out from playing all day, so I went to sleep almost immediately. It was a very good day that I'll always remember.",

'It is too late now, and I thank God that so it is.' \n\n'Do you indeed, M. le Baron?' said a low voice close beside him; and, as he turned in haste, he beheld, at the foot of the turret-stair, the youth Aime de Selinville, holding a dark lantern in his hand, and veiling its light. \n\n'Ha!' and he started to his feet.

Once inside, they raced to see the monkeys swinging around their cages. There were even two baby monkeys! The girls also enjoyed feeding birds in the walk-in bird cage. The birds were very interested in picking seeds from the popsicle stick that Emily held out to them. Next, it was time to stop for ice cream. Each girl chose a small cup of soft ice cream. Emily chose a swirl of chocolate and vanilla and Evelyn had chocolate. Ice cream at the zoo was the perfect treat on a hot summer day. The best part of the girls' visit was the giraffe area. They walked past rhinos and tortoises to get to the giraffe area which was on a raised deck. The giraffes stretched their necks up to the deck to eat leaves and hay that were placed there for them. Emily and Evelyn bought special crackers to feed to the giraffes. Emily liked that she could pet the giraffes when they reached out to grab the crackers with their long tongues. Evelyn liked to watch the giraffes, but did not want to feed one herself. After feeding the giraffes, the girls left the zoo, hot and tired and ready to return soon!",

Her mother told her that the best way to meet new friends was to go somewhere where other kids are at. She remembered seeing a park on the corner when they were moving in. She asked her mother if she could go to the park. Her mother walked her down the street to the park. When Gia got to the park she was not happy. There was no one there. She sat on a swing and looked at the ground. It seemed like this was going to be another lonely day. Gia heard a noise and looked up. There was a girl coming down the hill. She smiled, but she was a little scared. What if she wasn't nice? That would make her sad. Gia was so happy when the girl walked up and said, \"Hi, my name is Julie. What's yours?\"",

      "story": "16:9 (1.7:1) (16:9 = 4:3) is an aspect ratio with a width of 16 units and height of 9. Since 2010 it has become the most common aspect ratio for televisions and computer monitors, and is also the international standard format of HDTV, Full HD, non-HD digital television and analog widescreen television. This has replaced the old . \n\nDr. Kerns H. Powers, a member of the SMPTE Working Group on High-Definition Electronic Production, first proposed the 16:9 (1.7:1) aspect ratio at a time when nobody was creating 16:9 videos. The popular choices in 1980 were: 1.3:1 (based on television standard's ratio at the time), 1.6:1 (the European \"flat\" ratio), 1.85:1 (the American \"flat\" ratio), 2.20:1 (the ratio of 70\u00a0mm films and Panavision) and 2.39:1 (the CinemaScope ratio for anamorphic widescreen films). \n\nPowers cut out rectangles with equal areas, shaped to match each of the popular aspect ratios. When overlapped with their center points aligned, he found that all of those aspect ratio rectangles fit within an outer rectangle with an aspect ratio of 1.7:1 and all of them also covered a smaller common inner rectangle with the same aspect ratio 1.7:1. The value found by Powers is exactly the geometric mean of the extreme aspect ratios, 4:3 (1.3:1) and 2.35:1 (or 64:27, see also for more information), \u221a \u2248 1.770 which is coincidentally close to 16:9 (1.7:1). Applying the same geometric mean technique to 16:9 and 4:3 yields the aspect ratio, which is likewise used as a compromise between these ratios.",

She had heard Desgas giving orders to his men, and then starting off towards the fort, to get a reinforcement of a dozen more men: six were not thought sufficient to capture the cunning Englishman, whose resourceful brain was even more dangerous than his valour and his strength. \n\nThen a few minutes later, she heard the Jew's husky voice again, evidently shouting to his nag, then the rumble of wheels, and noise of a rickety cart bumping over the rough road. \n\nInside the inn, everything was still. Brogard and his wife, terrified of Chauvelin, had given no sign of life; they hoped to be forgotten, and at any rate to remain unperceived: Marguerite could not even hear their usual volleys of muttered oaths. \n\nShe waited a moment or two longer, then she quietly slipped down the broken stairs, wrapped her dark cloak closely round her and slipped out of the inn. \n\nThe night was fairly dark, sufficiently so at any rate to hide her dark figure from view, whilst her keen ears kept count of the sound of the cart going on ahead. She hoped by keeping well within the shadow of the ditches which lined the road, that she would not be seen by Desgas' men, when they approached, or by the patrols, which she concluded were still on duty. \n\nThus she started to do this, the last stage of her weary journey, alone, at night, and on foot. Nearly three leagues to Miquelon, and then on to the Pere Blanchard's hut, wherever that fatal spot might be, probably over rough roads: she cared not. ",

Established in 1986 as an independent national morning newspaper published in London, it was controlled by Tony O'Reilly's Independent News & Media from 1997 until it was sold to Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev in 2010. The last printed edition of \"The Independent\" was published Saturday 20 March 2016, leaving only its digital editions. \n\nNicknamed the \"Indy\", it began as a broadsheet, but changed to tabloid (compact) format in 2003. Until September 2011, the paper described itself on the banner at the top of every newspaper as \"free from party political bias, free from proprietorial influence\". It tends to take a pro-market stance on economic issues. \n\nThe daily edition was named \"National Newspaper of the Year\" at the 2004 British Press Awards. \n\nIn June 2015, it had an average daily circulation of just below 58,000, 85 per cent down from its 1990 peak, while the Sunday edition had a circulation of just over 97,000. \n\nLaunched in 1986, the first issue of \"The Independent\" was published on 7 October in broadsheet format. It was produced by Newspaper Publishing plc and created by Andreas Whittam Smith, Stephen Glover and Matthew Symonds. All three partners were former journalists at \"The Daily Telegraph\" who had left the paper towards the end of Lord Hartwell's ownership.

During all that time, though they were both in London, she never saw Jack De Baron, and she knew that in not seeing her he was neglecting her. But for so long she bore it. It is generally supposed that young ladies have to bear such sorrow without loud complaint; but Guss was more thoroughly emancipated than are some young ladies, and when moved was wont to speak her mind. At last, when she herself was only on foot with her father, she saw Jack De Baron riding with Lady George. It is quite true that she also saw, riding behind them, her perfidious friend, Mrs. Houghton, and a gentleman whom at that time she did not know to be Lady George's father. This was early in March, when equestrians in the park are not numerous. Guss stood for a moment looking at them, and Jack De Baron took off his hat. But Jack did not stop, and went on talking with that pleasant vivacity which she, poor girl, knew so well and valued so highly. Lady George liked it too, though she could hardly have given any reason for liking it, for, to tell the truth, there was not often much pith in Jack's conversation. \n\nOn the following morning Captain De Baron, who had lodgings in Charles Street close to the Guards' Club, had a letter brought to him before he was out of bed. The letter was from Guss Mildmay, and he knew the handwriting well. He had received many notes from her, though none so interesting on the whole as was this letter. Miss Mildmay's letter to Jack was as follows. It was written, certainly, with a swift pen, and, but that he knew her writing well, would in parts have been hardly legible. ",

Its ancient history saw the presence of the Thracians, Greeks, Persians, Celts, Romans, Goths, Alans and Huns. The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, which dominated most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during the Middle Ages. With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396, its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378 led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a one-party socialist state as part of the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. In December 1989 the ruling Communist Party allowed multi-party elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a democracy and a market-based economy.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Barcelona moved five points clear in Spain as manager Pep Guardiola celebrated his 100th match in charge with a 4-0 victory at home to Racing Santander on Saturday. \n\nThe injury-hit defending champions brushed off the pre-match loss of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic to romp into a 3-0 halftime lead as they put pressure on Real Madrid to win Sunday's home match against Villarreal. \n\nThe Swede is in doubt for Tuesday's Champions League trip to German club Stuttgart due to a swollen ankle. \n\nMidfielder Andres Iniesta took advantage of some slack defending to pounce for his first goal this season in the seventh minute, hooking home a left-foot effort after the ball ran loose in his 300th outing for the club. \n\nFrance striker Thierry Henry, handed a rare start due to Ibrahimovic's absence, netted a free-kick in the 29th minute after driving a shot through the defensive wall for his first goal this year. \n\nCenter-back Rafael Marquez marked his return from suspension with a similar effort nine minute later as he curled a set-piece over the wall and in off the post. \n\nBarca took their foot off the pedal in the second half, but 18-year-old Thiago scored his first senior goal in the 84th minute with a deflected shot after Lionel Messi set him up with a cutback. \n\nCaptain Carles Puyol had to go off with a facial injury but is expected to face Stuttgart in the first leg of the last-16 tie. \n\nIt was Guardiola's 71st victory since taking charge of the Catalan giants, and 14th-placed Racing never looked like inflicting his 11th defeat -- the 10th came against Atletico Madrid last weekend, Barca's first in La Liga this season.

      "story": "Anne and Joseph are talking about an interesting question. Why do some people change their names? There can be many reasons. Hanna changed her name to Anne because she thought it would be easier for people to remember. On the other hand, Joseph is thinking about changing his name to an unusual name because he wants to be different. \n\nPeople have a lot of reasons for changing their names. Film stars, singers, sportsmen and some other famous people often change their names because they want names that are not ordinary, or that have special sound. They chose the \"new name\" for themselves instead of the name their parents gave them when they were born. \n\nSome people have another reason for changing their names. They have moved to a new country and want to use a name that is usual there. For example, Li Kaiming changed his name to Ken Lee when he moved to the United States. He uses the name Ken at his job and at school. But with his family and Chinese friends, he uses Li Kaiming. For some people, using different names makes life easier in their new country. \n\nIn many countries, a woman changes her family name to her husband's after she gets married. But today, many women are keeping their own family name and not using their husband's. Sometimes, women use their own name in some situations and their husband's in other situations. And some use both their own name and their husband's.",

He inspired them by his words with fresh spirit and confidence, telling them that this state of things could not last, and that he was going to join the king, who doubtless would soon call them to take part in a fresh effort to drive out their cruel oppressors. Edmund found that although none knew with certainty the hiding-place of King Alfred, it was generally reported that he had taken refuge in the low lands of Somersetshire, and Athelney was specially named as the place which he had made his abode. \n\n\"It is a good omen,\" Edmund said, \"for Athelney lies close to the Parrot, where my good ship the Dragon is laid away.\" \n\nAfter visiting all the villages in his earldom Edmund started with Egbert and four young men, whom he might use as messengers, for the reported hiding-place of the king. First they visited the Dragon, and found her lying undisturbed; then they followed the river down till they reached the great swamps which extended for a considerable distance near its mouth. After much wandering they came upon the hut of a fisherman. The man on hearing the footsteps came to his door with a bent bow. When he saw that the new-comers were Saxons he lowered the arrow which was already fitted to the string. \n\n\"Can you tell us,\" Edmund said, \"which is the way to Athelney?

During all that time, though they were both in London, she never saw Jack De Baron, and she knew that in not seeing her he was neglecting her. But for so long she bore it. It is generally supposed that young ladies have to bear such sorrow without loud complaint; but Guss was more thoroughly emancipated than are some young ladies, and when moved was wont to speak her mind. At last, when she herself was only on foot with her father, she saw Jack De Baron riding with Lady George. It is quite true that she also saw, riding behind them, her perfidious friend, Mrs. Houghton, and a gentleman whom at that time she did not know to be Lady George's father. This was early in March, when equestrians in the park are not numerous. Guss stood for a moment looking at them, and Jack De Baron took off his hat. But Jack did not stop, and went on talking with that pleasant vivacity which she, poor girl, knew so well and valued so highly. Lady George liked it too, though she could hardly have given any reason for liking it, for, to tell the truth, there was not often much pith in Jack's conversation. \n\nOn the following morning Captain De Baron, who had lodgings in Charles Street close to the Guards' Club, had a letter brought to him before he was out of bed. The letter was from Guss Mildmay, and he knew the handwriting well. He had received many notes from her, though none so interesting on the whole as was this letter. Miss Mildmay's letter to Jack was as follows. It was written, certainly, with a swift pen, and, but that he knew her writing well, would in parts have been hardly legible. ",

He was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian \"gens\" Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir, then known as Octavianus (Anglicized as Octavian). He, Mark Antony, and Marcus Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi, the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC. \n\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself \"Princeps Civitatis\" (\"First Citizen of the State\"). The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, the first phase of the Roman Empire.",

Applicants here have waited as long as 60 days to secure an appointment at one of five U.S. consular locations in China that process visas. There, they're often greeted by long lines, followed by a face-to-face interview that can end badly in a matter of seconds. \n\nNow there are only about 100 U.S. visa officers in China, facing considerable challenges during the summer when tourists and students travel the most. \"It's not easy work,\" Charles Bennett, minister-counselor for Consular Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said to his staff. \"You're making, in some cases, life-changing decisions many times a day, and that can cause great tiredness.\" \n\nTo adapt, US consular services expanded their hours, took on about a dozen additional staff and hope to have another 20 officers by spring. More facilities are also being expanded. \n\nDespite the shocking numbers, the embassy remains troubled by charges that it rejects applicants unreasonably and that the process is unfairly burdensome. \"I'm fed up,\" said Wendy Liu, 24. The single woman from Beijing said she was recently refused a visa and told to re-apply when her personal life and finances were more stable. \"I'll go anywhere but the U.S. now,\" she said. \"I thought America was supposed to be a country of freedom.\" \n\nTo visit the US, Chinese nationals must prove that they have enough money and family or business ties that make it likely they'll return to China. The Department of Homeland Security said it did not keep records on how many Chinese overstay their visas. \n\nStudent visas can be refused on grounds of national security. Beijing native Tan Ge, 25, believes he was not accepted after he stated his interests in infrared technology and nanoelectronics on his application. He now studies in Canada after being forced to abandon a full scholarship to Arizona State University. \n\nBy its very nature, the on-the-spot process at the U.S. Embassy can feel unbearable to Chinese applicants, who are asked to take their bank statements, property deeds , marriage licenses and HUKOU, a Chinese household ID. \n\n\"It made me feel very uncomfortable,\" said Xu Yong, 28, a journalist who needed a business visa last month to cover a conference in New York. \"They made me feel like someone from a Third World country up to no good.\" \n\nAfter giving his fingerprints, Xu waited to be called for his interview, sitting in an area that was as quiet as a library. Each passing minute seemed to be as long as a century. \n\nAfter an hour, Xu was called with three other people to a window for their interview. Two were rejected before his turn. Then the American officer, speaking fluent Chinese, reached for Xu's paperwork, asked some simple questions and said, \"Congratulations.\" \n\n\"I was so nervous. The first thing I did when I got out was to call my mom and tell her I passed,\" Xu said. \"She was the one who warned me it wasn't going to be easy.\"",

Suppose he did meet with Dede out in the hills; and suppose, by some lucky stroke of fate, he should manage to be riding alongside of her; then that whirl of Bob's would be most disconcerting and embarrassing.

      "story": "The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, Mya. As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction events when 60% of marine species were wiped out. \n\nA significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of jawed and bony fish. Multi-cellular life also began to appear on land in the form of small, bryophyte-like and vascular plants that grew beside lakes, streams, and coastlines, and terrestrial arthropods are also first found on land during the Silurian. However, terrestrial life would not greatly diversify and affect the landscape until the Devonian. \n\nThe Silurian system was first identified by British geologist Roderick Murchison, who was examining fossil-bearing sedimentary rock strata in south Wales in the early 1830s. He named the sequences for a Celtic tribe of Wales, the Silures, inspired by his friend Adam Sedgwick, who had named the period of his study the Cambrian, from the Latin name for Wales. This naming does not indicate any correlation between the occurrence of the Silurian rocks and the land inhabited by the Silures. In 1835 the two men presented a joint paper, under the title \"On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales,\" which was the germ of the modern geological time scale. As it was first identified, the \"Silurian\" series when traced farther afield quickly came to overlap Sedgwick's \"Cambrian\" sequence, however, provoking furious disagreements that ended the friendship. Charles Lapworth resolved the conflict by defining a new Ordovician system including the contested beds. An early alternative name for the Silurian was \"\"Gotlandian\"\" after the strata of the Baltic island of Gotland.",

      "story": "An estimated eight million people in Britain enjoy walking in the Peak District every year. But what many who enjoy outdoor hobbies don't know is that their \"right to walk\" was won by men who sacrificed their own freedom to gain access to the countryside for all. \n\nIn 1932 wealthy landowners had private use of large areas of uplands for hunting. Walkers were kept out by guards, until a group of 400 people from Manchester and Yorkshire, led by Benny Rothman, engaged on a mass trespass . The campaigner was put into prison with four other men. \n\nThe event is supported by many with starting a movement that paved the way for the establishment of national parks. Mr Rothman died in 2002 but he is now being honoured for his contribution with the revealing of a blue plaque on his former home in Crofton Avenue, Timperley, Greater Manchester. \n\nRetired professor, Harry, who followed in his father's footsteps by specialising in environmental issues, says: \"He was a very optimistic man and he made the best of it when he went to prison. It did''t put him off campaigning, he went on campaigning on environmental issues most of his life.\" Mr Rothman did live to see the Countryside Rights of Way Act passed by Parliament in 2000, ensuring the freedom of the countryside for future generations. \n\nRoly Smith, a friend of Mr Rothman and an author of walking guidebooks, said: \"It is because of them that we have got what we have today.\" \n\nCouncillor Jonathan Coupe, of Trafford Council, said: \"The honour of having a blue plaque attributed to you means you have really made an impression on society.\" \n\n\"Mr Rothman contributed to the changing of history and it is because of him that we are able to enjoy the local countryside as often and freely as we can today.\"",

Ho Ho!\"--_Robin Goodfellow_. \n\nNotice was sent from the Bishop of the diocese that he was about to hold a Confirmation at Poppleby in six weeks' time. This was matter of rejoicing to Mr Harford, who had mourned over the very few communicants. Before he came the Celebrations had been only three times a year, and were attended by most of the aged paupers. To the joy of the Carbonels, the feast was monthly after his coming; but the first time the aged people were there, and all lingered, George Hewlett, the clerk, said, when the curate looked to him for information-- \n\n\"The alms, sir. They be waiting for the money in the plate.\" \n\n\"Why, that is to be reserved for sick and distressed.\" \n\n\"Mr Selby, he always give it out to them, and so did Mr Jones afore him, sir. They be all expecting of it.\" \n\nMr Harford thought that it might be best not to disappoint the old people suddenly, so he stood at the vestry door counting heads, and numbering among them two whom he had already been somewhat startled to see present themselves, namely, Dame Spurrell, whom he had heard abusing her neighbour with a torrent of foul words, and who pretended to be a witch, and Tom Jarrold, whom Hewlett had described to him as the wickedest old chap in the parish. \n\nHe took counsel with the churchwardens, Farmers Goodenough and Rawson, who both agreed that they were a bad lot, who didn't deserve nothing, but it helped to keep down the rates.

      "story": "He's out there somewhere, an instant icon in the records of American conflict, the final big-game hunter. But a puzzle, too, his identity would be kept a secret for now, and maybe forever. \n\nHe is the unknown shooter. The nameless, faceless triggerman who put a bullet in the head of the world's most notorious terrorist, Bin Laden. \n\nHe's likely between the ages of 26 and 33, says Marcinko, founder of the \"SEALs Team 6\" that many believe led the attack on Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He'll be old enough to have had time to hurdle the extra training tests required to join the counter-terrorism unit, yet young enough to stand the body-punishing harshness of the job. The shooter's a man, it's safe to say, because there are no women in the SEALs. And there's a good chance he's white, though the SEALs have stepped up efforts to increase the number of minorities in their ranks, Marcinko and Smith say. \n\nHe was probably a high school or college athlete, Smith says, a physical specimen who combines strength, speed and wisdom. \"They call themselves 'tactical athletes,'\" says Smith, who works with many future SEALs in his Heroes of Tomorrow training program in Severna Park. \"It's getting very scientific.\" \n\nMarcinko puts it in more conventional terms: \"He'll be ripped,\" says the author of the best-selling autobiography \"Rogue Warrior.\"\"He's got a lot of upper-body strength. Long arms. Thin waist. Flat stomach.\" \n\nOn this point, Greitens departs a bit. \"You can't make a lot of physical assumptions,\" says the author of \"The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL.\" There are SEALs who are 5 feet 4 and SEALs who are 6 feet 5, Greitens says. In his training group, he adds, there were college football boys who couldn't hack it; those who survived were most often men in good shape, but they also had a willingness to show their concerns in favor of the mission. \n\nThe shooter's probably not the crew-cut , neatly shaven ideal we've come to expect from American fighting forces. \"He's bearded, rough-looking, like a street naughty boy,\" Marcinko supposes. \"You don't want to stick out.\" Marcinko calls it \"modified grooming standards.\" \n\nHis hands will be calloused , Smith says, or just rough enough,\" as Marcinko puts it. And \"he's got frag in him somewhere,\" Marcinko says, using the battlefield shorthand for \"fragments\" of bullets or explosive devices. This will not have been the shooter's first adventure. Marcinko estimates that he might have made a dozen or more deployments , tours when he was likely to have dealt with quite a number of dangerous situations, getting ready any time for explosive devices or bullets.",

Muslims make up a majority of the population in 50 countries. Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful, unique and has guided mankind through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs. The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran, viewed by Muslims as the word of God, and the teachings and normative example (called the \"sunnah\", composed of accounts called \"hadith\") of Muhammad ( 570\u20138 June 632 CE). \n\nMuslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. As for the Quran, Muslims consider it to be the unaltered and final revelation of God. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded paradise and unrighteous punished in hell. Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, and following Islamic law, which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment.

      "story": "The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, Mya. As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction events when 60% of marine species were wiped out. \n\nA significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of jawed and bony fish. Multi-cellular life also began to appear on land in the form of small, bryophyte-like and vascular plants that grew beside lakes, streams, and coastlines, and terrestrial arthropods are also first found on land during the Silurian. However, terrestrial life would not greatly diversify and affect the landscape until the Devonian. \n\nThe Silurian system was first identified by British geologist Roderick Murchison, who was examining fossil-bearing sedimentary rock strata in south Wales in the early 1830s. He named the sequences for a Celtic tribe of Wales, the Silures, inspired by his friend Adam Sedgwick, who had named the period of his study the Cambrian, from the Latin name for Wales. This naming does not indicate any correlation between the occurrence of the Silurian rocks and the land inhabited by the Silures. In 1835 the two men presented a joint paper, under the title \"On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales,\" which was the germ of the modern geological time scale. As it was first identified, the \"Silurian\" series when traced farther afield quickly came to overlap Sedgwick's \"Cambrian\" sequence, however, provoking furious disagreements that ended the friendship. Charles Lapworth resolved the conflict by defining a new Ordovician system including the contested beds. An early alternative name for the Silurian was \"\"Gotlandian\"\" after the strata of the Baltic island of Gotland.",

Statistics have been kept for professional baseball since the creation of the National League and American League, now part of Major League Baseball. \n\nMany statistics are also available from outside of Major League Baseball, from leagues such as the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players and the Negro Leagues, although the consistency of whether these records were kept, of the standards with respect to which they were calculated, and of their accuracy varied. \n\nThe practice of keeping records of player achievements was started in the 19th century by Henry Chadwick. Based on his experience with the sport of cricket, Chadwick devised the predecessors to modern-day statistics including batting average, runs scored, and runs allowed. \n\nTraditionally, statistics such as batting average (the number of hits divided by the number of at bats) and earned run average (the average number of earned runs allowed by a pitcher per nine innings) have dominated attention in the statistical world of baseball. However, the recent advent of sabermetrics has created statistics drawing from a greater breadth of player performance measures and playing field variables. Sabermetrics and comparative statistics attempt to provide an improved measure of a player's performance and contributions to his team from year to year, frequently against a statistical performance average.",

It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative.

In a 1999 post to the \"ruby-talk\" mailing list, Ruby author Yukihiro Matsumoto describes some of his early ideas about the language: \n\nMatsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl. \n\nThe name \"Ruby\" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: \"Coral\" and \"Ruby\". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka. Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name \"Ruby\"\u00a0\u2013 it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues. \n\nThe first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on December 21, 1995.

D. \n\nApollo Crosbie left London for Allington on the 31st of August, intending to stay there four weeks, with the declared intention of recruiting his strength by an absence of two months from official cares, and with no fixed purpose as to his destiny for the last of those two months. Offers of hospitality had been made to him by the dozen. Lady Hartletop's doors, in Shropshire, were open to him, if he chose to enter them. He had been invited by the Countess de Courcy to join her suite at Courcy Castle. His special friend, Montgomerie Dobbs, had a place in Scotland, and then there was a yachting party by which he was much wanted. But Mr Crosbie had as yet knocked himself down to none of these biddings, having before him when he left London no other fixed engagement than that which took him to Allington. On the first of October we shall also find ourselves at Allington in company with Johnny Eames; and Apollo Crosbie will still be there,--by no means to the comfort of our friend from the Income-tax Office. \n\nJohnny Eames cannot be called unlucky in that matter of his annual holiday, seeing that he was allowed to leave London in October, a month during which few chose to own that they remain in town. For myself, I always regard May as the best month for holiday-making; but then no Londoner cares to be absent in May. Young Eames, though he lived in Burton Crescent and had as yet no connection with the West End, had already learned his lesson in this respect. \"Those fellows in the big room want me to take May,\" he had said to his friend Cradell. \"They must think I'm uncommon green.\" ",

Ho Ho!\"--_Robin Goodfellow_. \n\nNotice was sent from the Bishop of the diocese that he was about to hold a Confirmation at Poppleby in six weeks' time. This was matter of rejoicing to Mr Harford, who had mourned over the very few communicants. Before he came the Celebrations had been only three times a year, and were attended by most of the aged paupers. To the joy of the Carbonels, the feast was monthly after his coming; but the first time the aged people were there, and all lingered, George Hewlett, the clerk, said, when the curate looked to him for information-- \n\n\"The alms, sir. They be waiting for the money in the plate.\" \n\n\"Why, that is to be reserved for sick and distressed.\" \n\n\"Mr Selby, he always give it out to them, and so did Mr Jones afore him, sir. They be all expecting of it.\" \n\nMr Harford thought that it might be best not to disappoint the old people suddenly, so he stood at the vestry door counting heads, and numbering among them two whom he had already been somewhat startled to see present themselves, namely, Dame Spurrell, whom he had heard abusing her neighbour with a torrent of foul words, and who pretended to be a witch, and Tom Jarrold, whom Hewlett had described to him as the wickedest old chap in the parish. \n\nHe took counsel with the churchwardens, Farmers Goodenough and Rawson, who both agreed that they were a bad lot, who didn't deserve nothing, but it helped to keep down the rates. Then he talked to Captain Carbonel, who, being a reverent man, was dismayed at what he heard. ",

      "story": "The International Meridian Conference was a conference held in October 1884 in Washington, D.C., in the United States, to determine a prime meridian for international use. The conference was held at the request of U.S. President Chester A. Arthur. The subject to discuss was the choice of \"a meridian to be employed as a common zero of longitude and standard of time reckoning throughout the world\". It resulted in selection of the Greenwich Meridian as the international standard for zero degrees longitude. \n\nBy the 1870s there was pressure both to establish a prime meridian for worldwide navigation purposes and to unify local times for railway timetables. The first International Geographical Congress, held in Antwerp in 1871, passed a motion in favour of the use of the Greenwich Meridian for (smaller scale) passage charts, suggesting that it should become mandatory within 15 years. In Britain, the Great Western Railway had standardised time by 1840 and in 1847 the \"Railway Clearing Union\" decreed that \"GMT be adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it\". The Post Office was by this time transmitting time signals from Greenwich by telegraph to most parts of the country to set the clocks. By January 1848, Bradshaw's railway guide showed the unified times and met with general approval, although legal disputes meant that it was not until 1890 that GMT was formally established across the UK.",

Applicants here have waited as long as 60 days to secure an appointment at one of five U.S. consular locations in China that process visas. There, they're often greeted by long lines, followed by a face-to-face interview that can end badly in a matter of seconds. \n\nNow there are only about 100 U.S. visa officers in China, facing considerable challenges during the summer when tourists and students travel the most. \"It's not easy work,\" Charles Bennett, minister-counselor for Consular Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said to his staff. \"You're making, in some cases, life-changing decisions many times a day, and that can cause great tiredness.\" \n\nTo adapt, US consular services expanded their hours, took on about a dozen additional staff and hope to have another 20 officers by spring. More facilities are also being expanded. \n\nDespite the shocking numbers, the embassy remains troubled by charges that it rejects applicants unreasonably and that the process is unfairly burdensome. \"I'm fed up,\" said Wendy Liu, 24. The single woman from Beijing said she was recently refused a visa and told to re-apply when her personal life and finances were more stable. \"I'll go anywhere but the U.S. now,\" she said. \"I thought America was supposed to be a country of freedom.\" \n\nTo visit the US, Chinese nationals must prove that they have enough money and family or business ties that make it likely they'll return to China. The Department of Homeland Security said it did not keep records on how many Chinese overstay their visas. \n\nStudent visas can be refused on grounds of national security. Beijing native Tan Ge, 25, believes he was not accepted after he stated his interests in infrared technology and nanoelectronics on his application. He now studies in Canada after being forced to abandon a full scholarship to Arizona State University. \n\nBy its very nature, the on-the-spot process at the U.S. Embassy can feel unbearable to Chinese applicants, who are asked to take their bank statements, property deeds , marriage licenses and HUKOU, a Chinese household ID. \n\n\"It made me feel very uncomfortable,\" said Xu Yong, 28, a journalist who needed a business visa last month to cover a conference in New York. \"They made me feel like someone from a Third World country up to no good.\" \n\nAfter giving his fingerprints, Xu waited to be called for his interview, sitting in an area that was as quiet as a library. Each passing minute seemed to be as long as a century. \n\nAfter an hour, Xu was called with three other people to a window for their interview. Two were rejected before his turn. Then the American officer, speaking fluent Chinese, reached for Xu's paperwork, asked some simple questions and said, \"Congratulations.\" \n\n\"I was so nervous. The first thing I did when I got out was to call my mom and tell her I passed,\" Xu said. \"She was the one who warned me it wasn't going to be easy.\"",

Suppose he did meet with Dede out in the hills; and suppose, by some lucky stroke of fate, he should manage to be riding alongside of her; then that whirl of Bob's would be most disconcerting and embarrassing.

It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. \n\nRuby was conceived on February 24, 1993. In a 1999 post to the \"ruby-talk\" mailing list, Ruby author Yukihiro Matsumoto describes some of his early ideas about the language: \n\nMatsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl. \n\nThe name \"Ruby\" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: \"Coral\" and \"Ruby\". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka. Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name \"Ruby\"\u00a0\u2013 it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues. \n\nThe first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on December 21, 1995.

Thomas and Cookie were playing with the toys. Thomas kicked a ball to Cookie and Cookie kicked the ball back. Cookie got a toy fish out the box. Thomas and Cookie played catch with the toy fish. Penelope was laughing because she never saw a dog and cat play together. Mrs. Flower came to the backyard. She asked Penelope if she wanted yogurt, apple sauce or chocolate pudding with her breakfast. Penelope said she wanted yogurt.

      "story": "(CNN) -- A court in Fulton County, Georgia, has temporarily stopped the scheduled Monday night execution of condemned murderer Warren Hill. \n\nHill was sentenced to death for the 1990 killing of Joseph Handspike, another inmate in a Georgia state prison. \n\nHe was convicted of beating Handspike to death with a nail-studded board while serving a life sentence in the 1985 killing of his girlfriend, Myra Wright. His lawyers have argued that Hill is mentally retarded. \n\nLast minute stay of execution granted in February \n\n\"Today, the Court found that more time is needed to explore Mr. Hill's complaint, which raises serious concerns about the extreme secrecy surrounding the execution process in Georgia, and the new Lethal Injection Secrecy Act, which took effect one day before Georgia issued a death warrant for Mr. Hill,\" Brian Kammer, Hill's attorney said in a statement. \n\nMonday is not the first time Hill's execution has been halted. \n\nHe had previously been scheduled to die last July, but the state Supreme Court stopped the execution on procedural grounds. Hill was granted another stay in February. \n\nAccording to Kammer, a briefing on Hill's complaint will take place Thursday. A new execution date is expected to be set for the same day, he said. \n\n\"Ultimately, we are hopeful that the United States Supreme Court will hear Mr. Hill's pending Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, and will have the opportunity to consider the important new evidence in this case, that there is unanimous consensus among all the doctors who have examined Mr. Hill, including three who previously testified for the state, that he is a person with mental retardation, and thus ineligible for the death penalty,\" said Kammer.

      "story": "Telecommuncations in the United Kingdom have evolved from the early days of the telegraph to modern broadband and mobile phone networks with Internet services. \n\nNational Telephone Company (NTC) was a British telephone company from 1881 until 1911 which brought together smaller local companies in the early years of the telephone. Under the Telephone Transfer Act 1911 it was taken over by the General Post Office (GPO) in 1912. \n\nUntil 1982, the main civil telecommunications system in the UK was a state monopoly known (since reorganisation in 1969) as Post Office Telecommunications. Broadcasting of radio and television was a duopoly of the BBC and Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA): these two organisations controlled all broadcast services, and directly owned and operated the broadcast transmitter sites. Mobile phone and Internet services did not then exist. The civil telecoms monopoly ended when Mercury Communications arrived in 1983. The Post Office system evolved into British Telecom and was privatised in 1984. Broadcast transmitters, which belonged to the BBC and IBA, were privatised during the 1990s and now belong to Babcock International and Arqiva. \n\nBritish Rail Telecommunications was created in 1992 by British Rail (BR). It was the largest private telecoms network in Britain, consisting of 17,000 route kilometres of fibre optic and copper cable which connected every major city and town in the country and provided links to continental Europe through the Channel Tunnel. BR also operated its own national trunked radio network providing dedicated train-to-shore mobile communications, and in the early 1980s BR helped establish Mercury Communications\u2019, now C&WC, core infrastructure by laying a resilient \u2018figure-of-eight\u2019 fibre optic network alongside Britain\u2019s railway lines, spanning London, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester.",

Cross-dressing to join the army \n\nUntil recently, women have rarely been allowed to serve as soldiers. \n\nSo what was a gal to do if she wanted to serve her country? Naturally, disguise herself as a man and join the troops. \n\nAt least 400 Civil War soldiers were women in drag. These included Union Army soldier \"Frank Thompson\" (also known as Sarah Edmonds), whose small frame and feminine mannerisms (rather than causing suspicion) made her an ideal spy, as she could spy on the Confederates disguised as... a woman! \n\nShe wasn't the first woman to don a male disguise and join the army, though. During the Revolutionary War, women fought as men on both sides. \n\nHannah Snell, for example, joined the British army to find her husband, who had walked out on her to enlist. \n\nOnce her true sex was discovered (thanks to a pesky groin injury), she became a national celebrity in Britain, and made a post-war career of performing in bars as the \"Female Warrior.\" Mental Floss: The Confederacy's plan to conquer Latin America \n\n2.

Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including the Beverly Hills Hotel, and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. \n\nIn 1950, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association made the decision to establish a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry. Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry, the first award was presented to director and producer, Cecil B. DeMille.

It came with a watering pot, a shovel, a rake and seeds! The next morning we all went out to the backyard to start our garden. We dug a bunch of small holes with my new shovel, put a seed or two in each hole, and covered them up with dirt and raked over them. Our dog was very confused because he's the one that digs the holes. Every day I would get so excited to water them and see how big they'd gotten. Every day they would get even bigger. That was the most exciting part! Then they started making little tomatoes, and they sort of looked like grapes. And those too got bigger and bigger and started turning red. This was all very exciting and finally by Christmas my dad and I picked our fresh tomatoes and washed them to be eaten in a salad with dinner.",

Their teachers were the very best, so lessons were expensive, more than they could really afford, but...when you love your art, nothing is too much. But soon the money began to run out, and they couldn't afford the lessons any more. Then one day Delia came back home and told Joe that she had met a man whose daughter, Sally, wanted to learn the piano, and he was going to pay her $ 50 an hour. \"Delia,\" Joe said, \"I'll be much happier if you keep up your lessons,\" Delia said it didn't matter. \"When I've had some money, I'll continue.\" But Joe also decided to stop his lessons, to draw pictures and sell them. A few days later, Joe came home and proudly took $ 200 from his pocket. \"I met a man from Vermont,\" he said, \"who bought one of my pictures. And he wants to buy more!\" _ .They didn't have to worry any more about money. Then, one day, Joe came home and saw that Delia's hand was wrapped in a bandage .

Sally went straight to the drugstore and got this bandage for me. \" \"Delia, what have you been doing the last two weeks?\" Joe asked.

The amounts allowed were no doubt splendid, but it was not to them that the Roman governor looked as the source of that fortune which he expected to amass. The means of plunder were infinite, but of plunder always subject to the danger of an accusation. We remember how Verres calculated that he could divide his spoil into three sufficient parts--one for the lawyers, one for the judges, so as to insure his acquittal, and then one for himself. This plundering was common--so common as to have become almost a matter of course; but it was illegal, and subjected some unfortunate culprits to exile, and to the disgorging of a part of what they had taken. No accusation was made against Cicero. As to others there were constantly threats, if no more than threats. Cicero was not even threatened. But he had saved out of his legitimate expenses a sum equal to \u00a318,000 of our money--from which we may learn how noble were the appanages of a Roman governor. The expenses of all his staff passed through his own hands, and many of those of his army. Any saving effected would therefore be to his own personal advantage. On this money he counted much when his affairs were in trouble, as he was going to join Pompey at Pharsalia in the following year. He then begged Atticus to arrange his matters for him, telling him that the sum was at his call in Asia,[116] but he never saw it again: Pompey borrowed it--or took it; and when Pompey had been killed the money was of course gone.

His lawyers have argued that Hill is mentally retarded. \n\nLast minute stay of execution granted in February \n\n\"Today, the Court found that more time is needed to explore Mr. Hill's complaint, which raises serious concerns about the extreme secrecy surrounding the execution process in Georgia, and the new Lethal Injection Secrecy Act, which took effect one day before Georgia issued a death warrant for Mr. Hill,\" Brian Kammer, Hill's attorney said in a statement. \n\nMonday is not the first time Hill's execution has been halted. \n\nHe had previously been scheduled to die last July, but the state Supreme Court stopped the execution on procedural grounds. Hill was granted another stay in February. \n\nAccording to Kammer, a briefing on Hill's complaint will take place Thursday. A new execution date is expected to be set for the same day, he said. \n\n\"Ultimately, we are hopeful that the United States Supreme Court will hear Mr. Hill's pending Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, and will have the opportunity to consider the important new evidence in this case, that there is unanimous consensus among all the doctors who have examined Mr. Hill, including three who previously testified for the state, that he is a person with mental retardation, and thus ineligible for the death penalty,\" said Kammer.

      "story": "Telecommuncations in the United Kingdom have evolved from the early days of the telegraph to modern broadband and mobile phone networks with Internet services. \n\nNational Telephone Company (NTC) was a British telephone company from 1881 until 1911 which brought together smaller local companies in the early years of the telephone. Under the Telephone Transfer Act 1911 it was taken over by the General Post Office (GPO) in 1912. \n\nUntil 1982, the main civil telecommunications system in the UK was a state monopoly known (since reorganisation in 1969) as Post Office Telecommunications. Broadcasting of radio and television was a duopoly of the BBC and Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA): these two organisations controlled all broadcast services, and directly owned and operated the broadcast transmitter sites. Mobile phone and Internet services did not then exist. The civil telecoms monopoly ended when Mercury Communications arrived in 1983. The Post Office system evolved into British Telecom and was privatised in 1984. Broadcast transmitters, which belonged to the BBC and IBA, were privatised during the 1990s and now belong to Babcock International and Arqiva. \n\nBritish Rail Telecommunications was created in 1992 by British Rail (BR). It was the largest private telecoms network in Britain, consisting of 17,000 route kilometres of fibre optic and copper cable which connected every major city and town in the country and provided links to continental Europe through the Channel Tunnel. BR also operated its own national trunked radio network providing dedicated train-to-shore mobile communications, and in the early 1980s BR helped establish Mercury Communications\u2019, now C&WC, core infrastructure by laying a resilient \u2018figure-of-eight\u2019 fibre optic network alongside Britain\u2019s railway lines, spanning London, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester.",

The Britons had been overrun or culturally assimilated by other Celtic tribes during the British Iron Age and had been aiding Caesar's enemies. He received tribute, installed a friendly king over the Trinovantes, and returned to Gaul. Planned invasions under Augustus were called off in 34, 27, and 25\u00a0BC. In 40\u00a0AD, Caligula assembled 200,000 men at the Channel, only to have them gather seashells. Three years later, Claudius directed four legions to invade Britain and restore an exiled king over the Atrebates. The Romans defeated the Catuvellauni, and then organized their conquests as the Province of Britain (). By the year 47, the Romans held the lands southeast of the Fosse Way. Control over Wales was delayed by reverses and the effects of Boudica's uprising, but the Romans expanded steadily northward. \n\nUnder the 2nd century emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, two walls were built to defend the Roman province from the Caledonians, whose realms in the Scottish Highlands were never directly controlled. Around 197, the Severan Reforms divided Britain into two provinces: Britannia Superior and Britannia Inferior. During the Diocletian Reforms, at the end of the 3rd century, Britannia was divided into four provinces under the direction of a vicarius, who administered the . A fifth province, Valentia, is attested in the later 4th century. For much of the later period of the Roman occupation, Britannia was subject to barbarian invasions and often came under the control of imperial usurpers and imperial pretenders. The final Roman withdrawal from Britain occurred around 410; the native kingdoms are considered to have formed Sub-Roman Britain after that.",

Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including the Beverly Hills Hotel, and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. \n\nIn 1950, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association made the decision to establish a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry. Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry, the first award was presented to director and producer, Cecil B. DeMille. The official name of the award thus became the Cecil B. DeMille Award.",

      "story": "Propaganda is information that is not objective and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented. Propaganda is often associated with material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies and the media can also produce propaganda. \n\nIn the twentieth century, the term propaganda has been associated with a manipulative approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term. A wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages, which changed as new technologies were invented, including paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio shows, TV shows, and websites. \n\nIn a 1929 literary debate with Edward Bernays, Everett Dean Martin argues that, \u201cPropaganda is making puppets of us. We are moved by hidden strings which the propagandist manipulates.\u201d \n\n\"Propaganda\" is a modern Latin word, the gerundive form of \"propagare\", meaning \"to spread\" or \"to propagate\", thus \"propaganda\" means \"that which is to be propagated\". Originally this word derived from a new administrative body of the Catholic church (congregation) created in 1622, called the \"Congregatio de Propaganda Fide\" (\"Congregation for Propagating the Faith\"), or informally simply \"Propaganda\". Its activity was aimed at \"propagating\" the Catholic faith in non-Catholic countries.",

      "story": "Solar time is a calculation of the passage of time based on the position of the Sun in the sky. The fundamental unit of solar time is the day. Two types of solar time are apparent solar time (sundial time) and mean solar time (clock time). \n\nA tall pole vertically fixed in the ground casts a shadow on any sunny day. At one moment during the day, the shadow will point exactly north or south (or disappear when and if the Sun moves directly overhead). That instant is local apparent noon, or 12:00 local apparent time. About 24 hours later the shadow will again point north/south, the Sun seeming to have covered a 360-degree arc around the Earth's axis. When the Sun has covered exactly 15 degrees (1/24 of a circle, both angles being measured in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis), local apparent time is 13:00 exactly; after 15 more degrees it will be 14:00 exactly. \n\nThe problem is that in September the Sun takes less time (as measured by an accurate clock) to make an apparent revolution than it does in December; 24 \"hours\" of solar time can be 21 seconds less or 29 seconds more than 24 hours of clock time. As explained in the equation of time article, this is due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (i.e. the Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular, meaning that the Earth-Sun distance varies throughout the year), and the fact that the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit (the so-called obliquity of the ecliptic).",

We were all, I think, in different ways affected. Monsieur Feurg\u00e9res alone sat back in his seat like a carved image, his face white and haggard, his deep-set eyes fixed upon vacancy. We felt that he had passed wholly away from the world of present things. He himself was lingering amongst the shadows of that wonderful past, upon which he had only a moment before dropped the curtain. He had told us to ask him questions, but I for my part felt that questions just then were a sacrilege. Arthur, however, seemed to feel nothing of this. It was he who took the lead. \n\n\"Isobel, then,\" he said, \"is the granddaughter of the King of Waldenburg, the only child of his eldest daughter! Her mother was divorced from her husband, Prince of Herrshoff, and afterwards married to you. What about her father?\" \n\n\"He died two years after the divorce was granted,\" Feurg\u00e9res said without turning his head. \"Isobel was hurried away from the Court through the influence of her aunt, the Archduchess of Bristlaw, and sent to a convent in France. It was not intended that she should ever reappear at the Court of Waldenburg.\" \n\n\"Why not?\" \n\n\"The King is very old, and he is the richest man in Europe. Isobel is the daughter of his eldest and favourite child. The Archduchess also has a daughter, and, failing Isobel, she will inherit.\" ",

      "story": "Solar time is a calculation of the passage of time based on the position of the Sun in the sky. The fundamental unit of solar time is the day. Two types of solar time are apparent solar time (sundial time) and mean solar time (clock time). \n\nA tall pole vertically fixed in the ground casts a shadow on any sunny day. At one moment during the day, the shadow will point exactly north or south (or disappear when and if the Sun moves directly overhead). That instant is local apparent noon, or 12:00 local apparent time. About 24 hours later the shadow will again point north/south, the Sun seeming to have covered a 360-degree arc around the Earth's axis. When the Sun has covered exactly 15 degrees (1/24 of a circle, both angles being measured in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis), local apparent time is 13:00 exactly; after 15 more degrees it will be 14:00 exactly. \n\nThe problem is that in September the Sun takes less time (as measured by an accurate clock) to make an apparent revolution than it does in December; 24 \"hours\" of solar time can be 21 seconds less or 29 seconds more than 24 hours of clock time. As explained in the equation of time article, this is due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (i.e. the Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular, meaning that the Earth-Sun distance varies throughout the year), and the fact that the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit (the so-called obliquity of the ecliptic).",

      "story": "Chuck Berry, the man often called the \"father of rock and roll\" is still performing at 85. Another music great, Smokey Robinson, has described Chuck Berry as \"the inspiration for all of today's rock 'n' roll guitarists.\" And, Anthony Kiedis calls him \"a musical scientist who discovered a cure for the blues.\" \n\nOn stage, he became known for his wild performances, and his \"duck walk\" that many musicians copied. But his songwriting skills -- some call him a rock and roll poet -- and his guitar work really set him apart. Early in his career he played mostly blues for black audiences in clubs in St. Louis, Missouri. But the most popular music in the area was country. So this musical scientist mixed country and blues. \n\nChuck Berry was born on October 18th, 1926, in St. Louis, where he still lives. His mother, Martha, was a high school principal. He was born the fourth of six children. He started singing in church when he was six years old. His interest in music stuck with him. \n\nA lot of Chuck Berry's material is about teenage life, especially school. Chuck Berry and two friends were arrested after they used a gun to steal a car . He was released from prison four years later. But that would not be the last of his legal problems over the years. \n\nFilmmaker Taylor Hackford made a documentary called \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,\" named for a Chuck Berry song. It centered on the making of a concert to honor the musician on his sixtieth birthday in 1986. More than seventy-five artists and bands have done their own versions of Chuck Berry songs. Many have done several, including the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty and Bruce Springsteen. \n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, included Chuck Berry in its first year of honors in 1986. The Hall of Fame had this to say: \"While no individual can be said to have invented rock and roll, Chuck Berry comes the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together.\"",

Back in March, she testified in favor of a proposed Obama administration rule that would require Catholic institutions, like her own Georgetown University law school, to reject the teaching of their church and cover contraception in their university health plans -- plans not funded by taxpayers, by the way, but by tuition and other university revenues. \n\nNow here Fluke was again, on the national stage, warning that a vote for the Republican ticket in 2012 was a vote for \"an America in which you have a new vice president who co-sponsored a bill that would allow pregnant women to die preventable deaths in our emergency rooms. An America in which states humiliate women by forcing us to endure invasive ultrasounds we don't want and our doctors say we don't need. \n\n\"An America in which access to birth control is controlled by people who will never use it; in which politicians redefine rape so survivors are victimized all over again; in which someone decides which domestic violence victims deserve help, and which don't.\" \n\nShortly before Fluke spoke, conservative commentator Ann Coulter had tweeted: \"Bill Clinton just impregnated Sandra Fluke backstage.\" \n\nThat was nothing compared with the outpouring of fury during and after the speech.

      "story": "Sam Allred suffers from a rare and incurable kidney disease. One day, when his sister was playing a song repeatedly, Sam sang along. His sister thought it was funny so she recorded it and posted the video online. The video -- and Sam -- became a hit. Only 8 years old at the time, he couldn't have expected the response. \"(The television show) The Doctors called and wanted me on their show so they paid for me to go to California,\" says Sam, now 13, \"and we got to stay in a hotel where all the movie stars stayed.\" During that visit to California, Angie Allred, Sam's mother, had an idea about Sam writing a children's book. Together, she and Sam wrote Opening Hearts, which tells Sam's experience of living with a chronic illness. \"I wrote the book to teach people to be kinder to people,\" Sam says. Moreover, Sam wanted to send pillows to sick children staying in hospitals around the country to make their stay more comfortable, an idea that came from a time when he was in the hospital. \"A few kind boys came in with pillows and they gave me one and it meant a lot to me that someone cared about kids in the hospital,\" says Sam. Angie thought of starting a nonprofit organization to provide a way for people to contribute money to realize Sam's ideas. She named the nonprofit Kindness for Kids. Since then, Sam has taken pillows to children staying at Providence Hospital in Anchorage. Sam's father, Scott Allred, owns a small business that contracts shipping services with FedEx Ground. He asked the company for help. \"FedEx Ground learned about Sam's pillow project,\" says Erin Truxal, manager of public relations for FedEx Ground. \"We thought, 'What a perfect way for us to get involved.'\" The company provided shipping services for Sam to ship about 5,000 pillows to hospitals. Sam wants to send more pillows to all of the children's hospitals in every state. His goal is simple: \"Kids in the hospital as happy as they were before they got sick,\" he says.",

In 1998, Robinson published a collection of her critical and theological writings, The Death of Adam: Essays on Modern Thought, which featured reassessments of such figures as Charles Darwin, John Calvin, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Aside from a single short story--\"Connie Bronson,\" published in The Paris Review in 1986--it wasn't until 2004 that she returned to fiction with the novel Gilead, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize.

Housekeeping is the story of Ruth and her sister Lucille, who are cared for by their eccentric Aunt Sylvie after their mother commits suicide.

Gilead is an even more close exploration of personality: the book centres on John Ames, a seventy-seven-year-old pastor who is writing an account of his life and his family history to leave to his young son after he dies. Home borrows characters from Gilead but centers on Ames's friend Reverend Robert Boughton and his troubled son Jack.

Many older buildings fell down during the earthquake. \n\nThe damage in Santiago wasn't as bad as in other parts of Chile. So the supermarkets were open for business on the morning of the quake.

      "story": "Alice's Adventures in Wonderlandis one of the most loved children's books of all time, and many adults enjoy it as well. It tells the story of a young girl named Alice, who follows a rabbit entering a magical world called Wonderland. She has many experiences which seem to change the rules of reasoning or common sense. The popularity of the book comes from its imagination, interesting story, and art work. The writer of the book is Lewis Carroll. In fact, Lewis Carroll was not the writer's real name. His real name was Charles Dodgson. One day, he took a boat ride down the Thames River to have a picnic with three little girls who were friends of the family. To keep them entertained on the ride, he told them a story in which Alice, the middle child, was the main character. They enjoyed the story very much. Charles later wrote the story down under the nameAlice's Adventures Under Groundand gave it to Alice as a Christmas present. Later, he gave a copy to his friend George MacDonald. George read it to his children and they loved it. George suggested to Charles that he make a book from his story. Charles then wrote more parts to the story until it was around 35,000 words. It was first printed in 1866, with art work by John Tenniel, under the nameAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book was an immediate success. One of its first fans was Queen Victoria. She immediately requested a collection of all of Lewis Carroll's works. She was surprised to find that they included many works on math. In fact, Charles Dodgson was a highly respected mathematician. This can be seen in many puzzles and plays on reasoning that appear in his books and poems. Since the story was first printed, it has kept selling up to the present day. It has been translated into over fifty languages and has had several movies based on it.",

Witnesses told Canada's CTV news that Shahi said he wanted to bomb Canada. \n\nThe Boeing 737 -- which at that point was high above West Virginia -- was escorted back to Toronto by two U.S. fighter jets that were on an aerial training drill nearby, NORAD spokeswoman Capt. Jennifer Stadnyk told CNN. \n\nThe elder Shahi told CNN that Ali is not a violent person and did not mean what he said. He said his son is mentally ill, and has never gotten the support he's needed. \n\n\"Ali thinks life is a game,\" he said. \"We've called the cops 24 times in the past year on him. We've begged police for help, but they never do anything. They always send him back home.\" \n\nShahi said his son is a friendless, unemployed gambling addict who has suffered from depression and eating disorders for a decade. \"In high school, he was fat,\" he said. \"He was bullied until he became anorexic.\" ",

Family education plays an important role to the children. The \"king\" of fairy tales Zheng Yuanjie told us the story between his father, his son and him. His father helped him fill the pen in order to let Zheng focus on writing. His father set us a good example on how to be a nice father. Zheng is nice to his father, too. He bought a TV for his father and his son learnt from him. The moving story really touched my heart. It made me know how important it is to teach by precept and example role. Joey Yung told us that how her mother taught her to be a polite girl. We should think about others when we do something we like. We need try to be popular people. She reminded us of good manners in our daily life. Qin Yong, a famous rock star, gave up his career and put all his heart in educating his sick son. Though he felt too tired, he never quitted. It's his duty to bring his son up. When he found that his son made great progress, he felt very happy. The orphans' life made us deeply moved. From their father, we know that if we encourage a person, he will have self-improvement. From this program, we know that we should love the people around us.

Without the reindeer, how would Santa fly from home to home? The most important thing that Santa has to do for the reindeer is to make sure they have their coffee on Christmas Eve. Without the coffee, they won't stay awake for very long. Sleeping reindeer are not very helpful. Santa also gives the reindeer candy to keep up their energy. In the North Pole, the main candy is candy canes in red and white. Reindeer love the candy canes that are different colors best and Santa says that helps them fly faster. Next, Santa has to make sure that the reindeer have a good meal before they go. Santa wants to make sure he doesn't have to share the cookies kids leave for him. The last thing Santa has to do is make sure the reindeer know where they are going. Santa has only been lost one time on Christmas Eve and he does not want that to happen again.",

      "story": "On 17 March 2003, Robin Cook, Leader of the House of Commons and former Foreign Secretary, resigned from the Cabinet in protest against the coming war in Iraq. His resignation speech inspired the first long applause in the history of the House and marked the end of the ministerial career of one of Labor's most brilliant politicians. \n\nFor the previous two years, Robin Cook kept a diary, a personal record of the life of Labor's second term, a diary that forms the center of the narrative . The Point of Departureis Robin Cook's plain account of this extraordinary period in our political history, the most important political publication of the decade. Though surprised by his abrupt dismissal as Foreign Secretary, he became determined to bring about some changes in Parliamentary democracy that he believed was essential if Parliament was to move into the 21stcentury. As Tony Blair told him, \"This is the job for you.\" \n\nDrawing on first-hand experiences in the Commons and the Cabinet, of encounters in conferences, and late night conversations, we follow his gathering disillusionment as the political compass of the government changes to directions which he believes to be completely mistaken: from its failure about Lords reform and its unwillingness to provide leadership for social change, to a foreign policy which has led us away from our responsibility in Europe, into closer relationship with the most right-wing government in American history, and participation in Bush's war on Iraq. \n\nThis is the story of a government in power and the tensions between those who govern. But above all it is a story of a politician who truly wanted to bring democracy closer to the people, but who saw a government increasingly separated from the values of himself and his party, and who developed a growing belief that on Iraq, its position was morally, diplomatically and politically wrong. \n\nRobin Cook first entered Parliament as MP for Edinburgh Central in 1974. He held a number of senior positions in Opposition -- Shadow Foreign Secretary, Shadow Health and Social Services Secretary -- before becoming Foreign Secretary in 1997. In 2001 he was appointed Leader of the House of Commons, a position from which he resigned in March 2003 in protest against the coming war in Iraq.",

In November, both incumbent Gbagbo and challenger Ouattara claimed victory in the presidential election run-off. An independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner, but Gbagbo has refused to step aside. \n\nMallet said other rights abuses include using heavy artillery and rocket-launched grenades against protesters, the destruction of mosques, denial of medical care for Ouattara loyalists and the use of rape and sexual assault as a tactic. Gbagbo is also tracking down Ouattara backers on social networks and chat rooms, Mallet said. \n\nThe Young Patriots are run by Charles Ble Goude, Gbagbo's minister of youth. On Friday, he called on Gbagbo supporters to impede the movement of United Nations forces around the country \"by any means.\" \n\nThere have also been clashes between Gbagbo and Ouattara supporters in the central cities, Yamoussoukro and Daoukro, in addition to ongoing fighting in Abidjan.

Doe.\" \n\nAnother alleged poisoning victim was identified as Daniel Plowman, but no age or other information was immediately provided. \n\nThe latest charges also include one count of child abuse endangerment relating to the unidentified child, who was allegedly in Huckaby's \"care and custody.\" Read the complaint (PDF) \n\nHuckaby did not enter a plea in the Cantu slaying in her first two court appearances last month. \n\nAt an earlier hearing, Judge Linda L. Loftis agreed to keep the autopsy and toxicology reports under seal, citing a \"great danger of public outrage.\" \n\nIf convicted on the murder, rape and kidnapping charges, Huckaby, could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, authorities said. \n\nCNN's Alan Duke and Jim Roope contributed to this report \n\n",

      "story": "As the governing body of association football, FIFA is responsible for maintaining and implementing the rules that determine whether an association football player is eligible to represent a particular country in officially recognised international competitions and friendly matches. In the 20th century, FIFA allowed a player to represent any national team, as long as the player held citizenship of that country. In 2004, in reaction to the growing trend towards naturalisation of foreign players in some countries, FIFA implemented a significant new ruling that requires a player to demonstrate a \"clear connection\" to any country they wish to represent. FIFA has used its authority to overturn results of competitive international matches that feature ineligible players. \n\nFIFA's eligibility rules also demand that in men's competitions, only men are eligible to play, and that in women's competitions, only women are eligible to play. \n\nHistorically, it was possible for players to play for different national teams. For example, Alfredo di Stefano played for Argentina (1947) and Spain (1957\u201361). \n\nDi Stefano's Real Madrid teammate Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s also played for Spain after amassing 85 caps for Hungary earlier in his career. A third high-profile instance of a player switching international football nationalities is Jose Altafini, who played for Brazil in the 1958 FIFA World Cup and for Italy in the subsequent 1962 FIFA World Cup.",

Yet most people have a story about a broken relationship. \n\nFor Jane Black, a six-year friendship ended when her friend was rude to one of her children. \"After quite a few drinks at a party in my house, she said something rude to my child. I ended the friendship face to face at the party,\" she says. \"I didn't realize what I was doing at the time, I was simply standing up for my child, but in her eyes any challenge was a betrayal.\" \n\nWhen Angela Thompson noticed a seven-year friendship disappearing, she let it go. \"I didn't know how to deal with the issue. I didn't sit down for a grown-up conversation; I just walked away quietly.\" The decision caused a reaction among Thompson's other friends. \"The other friends in the circle are the worst people when you are trying to break up with a friend,\" she says. \"They don't want you to stop being friends, because it puts them in a difficult position. You get told to just get it over.\" \n\nThough we have plenty of measures for handling conflict at work or family fight, we still don't have good ways of ending friendships. Do we sit down and properly break up, or just walk away? Psychologist Serena Cauchy has the following advice. \n\nDon't blame. \n\nTalk about your needs and feeling rather than talking like a Dutch uncle. \n\nDo talk about your needs. \n\nTalk about why the friendship is not working for you--about how your needs aren't being met. \n\nDon't gossip. \n\nNegative talk hurts everyone involved and in some cases can make matters worse. \n\nDon't be so accessible. \n\nIf there is a common wish to conclude the friendship, then you can remove it.",

That evening when she asked her dad the same question, he didn't say anything.

He was determined that his first-born son would follow him into the blacksmith. For this reason, Edward had to leave school at the age of 12,and worked with his father. \n\nHowever, Edward was _ a blacksmith. Although he has an athletic body, he didn't have strong arms like his father, and he felt dizzy in the heat of the smithy. When he tried to find alternative employment, he found it difficult because he had never learnt to read or write. \n\nOne day, he went for an interview at a solictior's office. The job was a runner, taking documents from the office to other offices in the city. The solicitor was pleased to see that Edward was physically fit, but when he discovered that the young man couldn't read or write, he decided against employing him. \"How can you deliver documents to other offices,\" he asked, \"if you can't read the addresses on them?\" \n\nBitterly disappointed, Edward left the building and went to wait for a tram to take him back to the suburb where his father's smithy was. Next to the bus stop, a man was selling newspapers from a stand . \n\n\"Excuse me, son?\" he said. \"Would you look after my stand for a moment?\" \n\nFor the next 20 minutes, Edward sold newspapers, lots of them. When the man came back, he was so delighted with his new assistant's honesty, that he offered him a job. Edward took it immediately. \n\nIn the next few months, the two men progressed from working on newspaper stands to selling newspapers, tobacco,confectionery and other goods in a shop. Then they opened a second shop, and a third. Eventually, they had a chain of 25 shops in three cities. \n\nEdward became very rich, so he employed a tutor to teach him to read and write. The tutor was amazed at what Edward had achieved. \"Imagine what you could do if you'd been able to read and write when you were younger!\" he said. \n\n\"Yes!\" said Edward. \"I could have run myself to exhaustion delivering documents for a solicitor!\"",

The app lets deaf people create their own hand signs to communicate with friends. The app now has more than 10,000 deaf users. And Mach thinks there will be about 150,000 more deaf users next year. Mach says, \"I love to create. I will stick to it to the end of my life.\" William Zhou was born in Beijing and grew up in Canada. He strongly wanted to make a change in education. So he created CHALK. It is a group of programs that supports individual teaching and learning. CHALK is now used in 20,000 schools by more than 100,000 users worldwide. Zhou says you have to find something you truly care about. Or you may just end up giving it up. George was born in Tanzania . He learned about renewable energy in Europe and began thinking about using solar energy in Africa. Tanzania is a place with bright sunshine, but more than 90 percent of people have no electricity to use. After graduation, George returned to Tanzania and started his own company, SunSweet Solar. It has found early success in rural areas. George hopes to create jobs and help build his country. He understands the process will take time. \"But I think we are on the right way.\"",

      "story": "While other countries debate whether to fix wind turbines offshore or in distant areas, Denmark is building them right in its capital. Three windmills were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97. \n\n\"We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,\" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. \"But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must.\" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital. \n\nWith wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power. \n\nNow turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption. \n\nThough considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares. \n\nEach share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. \"There are a lot of things you can do close to people if it's not too big and if there's a model where locals feel involved and get to share in the profit. Knowing that you, or your neighbours, own a technology creates a very different atmosphere than if a multinational owned it,\" says Vad Mathiesen. \n\nGoing green? Yes. Accepted by the population? Yes. Going with centuries-old city architecture? Hardly. \n\nCertainly, the three turbines don't exactly _ the 18th-century city centre, as they are in a neighbourhood 3 km away. According to the mayor's office, none of the remaining 97 turbines will rise in architecturally sensitive areas. But Sascha Haselmayer, CEO of city creation group Citymart, warns, \"With Denmark being a world-leading producer of windmills, there is a risk that the answer to every energy question is windmills.\" \n\n\"We've destroyed mountains and lakes in order to support our lifestyle,\" notes Irena Bauman, an architect and professor at Sheffield University. \"Wind turbines are a sign that we're learning to live with nature. I hope we'll have them all over the world,\" she says. \"They may be unpleasant to some, but better-looking ones will come. It's just that we don't have time to wait for them!\"",

It offers satellite imagery, street maps, 360\u00b0 panoramic views of streets (Street View), real-time traffic conditions (Google Traffic), and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle (in beta), or public transportation. \n\nGoogle Maps began as a C++ desktop program designed by Lars and Jens Eilstrup Rasmussen at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites, and offers a locator for urban businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map Maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March, 2017. However crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps are not ending as the company announced those features will be transferred to Google's Local Guides programme. \n\nGoogle Maps' satellite view is a \"top-down\" or \"birds eye\" view; most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at , while most other imagery is from satellites. Much of the available satellite imagery is no more than three years old and is updated on a regular basis. Google Maps uses a close variant of the Mercator projection, and therefore cannot accurately show areas around the poles.",

Tom was so excited he could scream! Knowing that the man was watching, he played the best game ever that day.

His mom walked in and asked what Tom was doing. \"I'm going to play for the Yankees ma!\" Tom said. Tom's mom was so excited that she took Tom and the whole family out for dinner. Grandpa, Grandma, Mom and Dad were all there, and bought Tom a big cake! As Tom said goodbye to everyone, he couldn't help but feel sad that he would be gone for so long. \"Don't worry son, we'll be at all the games cheering you on!\" said his dad. This made Tom happy again, and as he left to be with his team, he knew that he had finally made it.",

While John is looking at the flowers, a young man comes inside. 'How many roses can I buy for only five dollars , madam?' he asks. The shopkeeper tells him that a dozen of roses is forty dollars. Maybe he can buy some carnations . They are much cheaper. 'No, I only want to have red roses,' he says. 'My mum was badly ill and I didn't spend much time with her. Now I want to give her something special, it must be roses because rose is her favorite.' After hearing it, John says he can help him pay for the rest of the money. The shopkeeper is moved and says, 'Well, lovely young men, thirty dollars a dozen, only for you.' Taking the roses, the young man almost jumps into the air and runs out of the shop. Then John pays for his dozen of roses and tells the shopkeeper to send them to his mother. As he walks out, he feels nice. Suddenly he sees the young man crossing the street and going into a park. But soon John knows it is not a park but a cemetery . Crying, the young man carefully puts down the roses, 'Mum, oh, Mum, why didn't I tell you how much I loved you? God, please help me find my mum and tell her I love her.' Seeing this, John turns and quickly walks to the shop. He will take the flowers home himself.",

There was hunting on both of those days, the gentlemen having gone on the Friday away out of Sir Harry's country to the Brake hounds. Ayala and the Colonel had arrived on the Thursday. Ayala had not expected to be asked to hunt again,--had not even thought about it. It had been arranged before on Nina's account, and Nina now was not to hunt any more. Lord George did not altogether approve of it, and Nina was quite in accord with Lord George,--though she had held up her whip and shaken it in triumph when she jumped over the Cranbury Brook. And the horse which Alaya had ridden was no longer in the stables. \"My dear, I am so sorry; but I'm afraid we can't mount you,\" Lady Albury said. In answer to this Ayala declared that she had not thought of it for a moment. But yet the days seemed to be dull with her. Lady Rufford was,--well,--perhaps a little patronising to her, and patronage such as that was not at all to Ayala's taste. \"Lady Albury seems to be quite a kind friend to you,\" Lady Rufford said. Nothing could be more true. The idea implied was true also,--the idea that such a one as Ayala was much in luck's way to find such a friend as Lady Albury. It was true no doubt; but, nevertheless, it was ungracious, and had to be resented. \"A very kind friend, indeed. Some people only make friends of those who are as grand as themselves.\" ",

He was determined that his first-born son would follow him into the blacksmith. For this reason, Edward had to leave school at the age of 12,and worked with his father. \n\nHowever, Edward was _ a blacksmith. Although he has an athletic body, he didn't have strong arms like his father, and he felt dizzy in the heat of the smithy. When he tried to find alternative employment, he found it difficult because he had never learnt to read or write. \n\nOne day, he went for an interview at a solictior's office. The job was a runner, taking documents from the office to other offices in the city. The solicitor was pleased to see that Edward was physically fit, but when he discovered that the young man couldn't read or write, he decided against employing him. \"How can you deliver documents to other offices,\" he asked, \"if you can't read the addresses on them?\" \n\nBitterly disappointed, Edward left the building and went to wait for a tram to take him back to the suburb where his father's smithy was. Next to the bus stop, a man was selling newspapers from a stand . \n\n\"Excuse me, son?\" he said. \"Would you look after my stand for a moment?\" \n\nFor the next 20 minutes, Edward sold newspapers, lots of them. When the man came back, he was so delighted with his new assistant's honesty, that he offered him a job. Edward took it immediately. \n\nIn the next few months, the two men progressed from working on newspaper stands to selling newspapers, tobacco,confectionery and other goods in a shop. Then they opened a second shop, and a third. Eventually, they had a chain of 25 shops in three cities. \n\nEdward became very rich, so he employed a tutor to teach him to read and write. The tutor was amazed at what Edward had achieved. \"Imagine what you could do if you'd been able to read and write when you were younger!\" he said. \n\n\"Yes!\" said Edward. \"I could have run myself to exhaustion delivering documents for a solicitor!\"",

If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison on each count. \n\nMehravar, asked if he would have assisted someone next to him who was dying, said he would normally have done so, but the conditions in the lodge made that difficult. \"I wasn't 100% aware, alert of what was going on around me.\" \n\nResponding to a follow-up question, Mehravar said he would have waited until a round was over to ask for help. The sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds, with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes. While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds. \n\nMehravar said he would not have tried to stop the ceremony: \"I don't think I would. I know it doesn't sound logical.\" \n\n\"I think Mr. Ray would have got upset if I had interrupted the ceremony,\" he said. \n\nProsecutors maintain Ray psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they weren't feeling well, contributing to the deaths of the three victims.

Three windmills were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97. \n\n\"We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,\" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. \"But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must.\" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital. \n\nWith wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power. \n\nNow turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption. \n\nThough considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares. \n\nEach share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. \"There are a lot of things you can do close to people if it's not too big and if there's a model where locals feel involved and get to share in the profit. Knowing that you, or your neighbours, own a technology creates a very different atmosphere than if a multinational owned it,\" says Vad Mathiesen. \n\nGoing green? Yes. Accepted by the population? Yes. Going with centuries-old city architecture? Hardly. \n\nCertainly, the three turbines don't exactly _ the 18th-century city centre, as they are in a neighbourhood 3 km away. According to the mayor's office, none of the remaining 97 turbines will rise in architecturally sensitive areas. But Sascha Haselmayer, CEO of city creation group Citymart, warns, \"With Denmark being a world-leading producer of windmills, there is a risk that the answer to every energy question is windmills.\" \n\n\"We've destroyed mountains and lakes in order to support our lifestyle,\" notes Irena Bauman, an architect and professor at Sheffield University. \"Wind turbines are a sign that we're learning to live with nature. I hope we'll have them all over the world,\" she says. \"They may be unpleasant to some, but better-looking ones will come. It's just that we don't have time to wait for them!\"",

Mohun Appears For The Last Time In This History \n\nBesides my Lord Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, who, for family reasons, had kindly promised his protection and patronage to Colonel Esmond, he had other great friends in power now, both able and willing to assist him, and he might, with such allies, look forward to as fortunate advancement in civil life at home as he had got rapid promotion abroad. His grace was magnanimous enough to offer to take Mr. Esmond as secretary on his Paris embassy, but no doubt he intended that proposal should be rejected; at any rate, Esmond could not bear the thoughts of attending his mistress farther than the church-door after her marriage, and so declined that offer which his generous rival made him. \n\nOther gentlemen, in power, were liberal at least of compliments and promises to Colonel Esmond. Mr. Harley, now become my Lord Oxford and Mortimer, and installed Knight of the Garter on the same day as his grace of Hamilton had received the same honour, sent to the colonel to say that a seat in Parliament should be at his disposal presently, and Mr. St. John held out many flattering hopes of advancement to the colonel when he should enter the House.

Speaking at a space conference at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, robotics expert and co-founder of the BRL, Alan Winfield, identified it as one of a number of advancements that might be useful to space scientists planning future missions. \n\n\"I was speculating that whiskers could provide a planetary rover with the ability to feel its way around,\" he told CNN.

      "story": "London (CNN) -- What do artificial whiskers and coffee-filled balloons have in common? \n\nThe answer is that they are both tools on experimental robots -- but they are also being put forward as possible ideas to help future planetary explorations. \n\n\"Shrewbot\" is the latest in a line of robots developed by teams at the UK's Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL) that aims to test whether artificial whiskers could help a robot find its way around. \n\nInspired by the Etruscan shrew -- one of the world's tiniest mammals -- scientists wanted to find out if a robot could explore its environment using touch instead of vision, just as rats, mice and shrews find food in the dark. \n\nTeam leader Martin Pearson, who works at the Biotact project, said the research was primarily to assist biologists in their understanding of how an animal's touch sensing works. \n\nBut he added: \"Future robotic applications for this kind of sensing could be in search-and-rescue robots operating in smoke filled buildings or for sub-sea pipeline inspection robots in the murky depths of the sea.\" \n\nThe idea has also been suggested as a way to explore planetary surfaces where there is limited vision. Speaking at a space conference at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, robotics expert and co-founder of the BRL, Alan Winfield, identified it as one of a number of advancements that might be useful to space scientists planning future missions. \n\n\"I was speculating that whiskers could provide a planetary rover with the ability to feel its way around,\" he told CNN.

The island is part of the Commonwealth of Australia. Together with two neighbouring islands, it forms one of Australia's external territories. It has 1,796 inhabitants living on a total area of about 35 km2 (14 sq mi). Its capital is Kingston. \n\nNorfolk Island was colonised by East Polynesians but was long unpeopled when it was settled by Great Britain as part of its settlement of Australia from 1788. The island served as a convict penal settlement from 6 March 1788 until 5 May 1855, except for an 11-year hiatus between 15 February 1814 and 6 June 1825, when it lay abandoned. On 8 June 1856, permanent civilian residence on the island began when it was settled from Pitcairn Island. In 1913, the UK handed Norfolk over to Australia to administer as an external territory.",

      "story": "\"Show them the money!\" That's what some people are saying for college athletes. They say students who play sports for their school should receive salaries. \n\nTop athletes should be paid because many of them practice full time, Mark Jameson argues. Rico Cannon, a former college football player, agrees. \"Nonathletes can get a job for extra spending money, but many student athletes spend so many hours in training that they don't have time to work,\" he explains. \"Shouldn't athletes be able to earn extra money too?\" \n\nThe students also make money for their schools when people buy tickets to their games. The players should receive some of that cash, supporter Robbie Pokora reasons. \n\nCollege athletes are about honor and tradition, but they're also a business. Thanks to ticket sales, there's money for schools to build new athletic stadiums and give the coaches high salaries. The cash should be shared with athletes. They're the ones out on the field or court working hard for their school. \n\nThe money matter has others _ , though. Kaitlyn Rentala argues that colleges should not pay their athletes. Students are in school to get an education. Playing a sport is an extracurricular activity, not a job. If athletes need extra money, they can apply for college scholarships . Michael Massett is a middle school teacher and a football and a basketball coach. He agrees. \"Athletes should be paid with scholarships, like nonathletes are,\" Massett explains. \n\nIn addition, if colleges pay their athletes, those students might focus more on sports than on their education. \"Most students do not become professional athletes after college. If they focus too much on sports, they may not learn the skills they need to get good jobs,\" Kate Macrae reasons. Plus, she says, many athletes have schoolships that help them pay for school.",

In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. \n\nTypically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna.",

The tree was cut too short. John crossed his arms tight across his chest. His eyes filled with angry tears. \n\nI felt worried The tree was central to our holiday. I didn't want the boys to feel ashamed every tune they looked at it. I couldn't lower the ceiling, and I couldn't raise the floor either. There was no way to undo the damage done.

On 3rd March 2016 children of all ages in the UK will come together to appreciate reading. Sometimes, reading a modern novel can be tough ( Booker Prize winner The Luminaries runs to 832 pages! ), especially if reading is not your strong suit. In fact, one in six people in the UK never pick up a book because they've experienced difficulties or are out of the habit of reading for pleasure. \n\nThe Galaxy Quick Reads series are designed to introduce reluctant readers to bestselling short funny novels, which bring the joy of reading without demanding hours of concentrated time. They cover a range of subjects, from romance to comedy. \n\nJojo Moyes's Paris For One is a romantic adventure in which 26-year-old Nell books a weekend away to Paris with her lazy, neglectful boyfriend. When he fails to turn up, she is alone in the city. That is, until she meets Fabien, who shows her the charms of the French capital -- in more ways than one. \n\nAdele Geras's moving story Out In The Dark was set in World War I, in which young Rob came back from the battlefields. Determined to find the officer's widow to return the photo of her and their daughter that the captain kept with him, he traveled several thousand miles but never gave up. \n\nDead Man Talking is a fantastic tale of Pat, who had a terrible fight with his best friend, Joe, ten years ago -- but now hears that Joe is dead, and he must attend his funeral.

He was charged with first and second degree murder, sexual assault and burglary, said Anchorage Police Sgt. Slawomir Markiewicz. Active is being held on $1.5 million bond. \n\nMarkiewicz said police were called to the home shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday. When they arrived, they found Touch Chea, 71, and his wife, Sorn Sreap, 73, dead, apparently due to blunt force trauma to the head and face, Markiewicz said. Autopsies are pending. \n\nPolice also found in the home the couple's great-granddaughter, who was sexually assaulted. Sreap had also been sexually assaulted, police said. \n\n\"I've been in the homicide unit for the last eight years and it's certainly one of the worst homicides we've seen in our town, in our city,\" Markiewicz told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Monday night. \n\nThe sergeant said the 2-year-old's father told police that he and his wife, who is pregnant, lived in the home with their children -- ages 4 and 2 -- along with Chea, Sreap and another relative. \n\nThey took their 4-year-old to the movies on Saturday, leaving their youngest in the care of the child's great-grandparents. \n\nWhen they returned, the front door was locked and there was a chain on from the inside, blocking their way.

      "story": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- An American professor doing research in London stumbled across a series of previously unknown letters written by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin, a stunning find that sheds new light on early U.S. history. \n\nThe letters cover Benjamin Franklin's success in dealing with a British general. \n\nThe collection of 47 letters are hand-written copies made 250 years ago, when Franklin lived in London. That they were filed under the copyist's name, not Franklin's, may explain why they were overlooked by historians until now, said a curator at the British Library, where the letters are held. \n\nThe find is reported in the April issue of the William & Mary Quarterly, a journal of early American history and culture. \n\nThe letters are important in large part because they offer a \"wealth of new details\" that affect modern understanding of Franklin, writes Alan Houston, the political science professor who discovered the letters in the spring of 2007. \n\nThey also raise the question of how many other documents remain waiting to be found on Franklin and his life. \n\nHouston, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, discovered the letters on the last day of his last research trip to London, just before the library's closing time. \n\n\"The first item was a letter from Benjamin Franklin to the secretary of the governor of Maryland, and I looked at it and I started to read, and I thought, 'This doesn't look familiar,'\" Houston told CNN. \"I've read everything Franklin ever wrote.\" ",

      "story": "New York (CNN) -- A woman suspected of snatching an infant from a New York hospital in 1987 told investigators she was frustrated with her inability to give birth, according to court papers filed Monday. \n\nAnn \"Annugetta\" Pettway has been charged with one count of kidnapping in the abduction of Carlina Renae White, who has since reunited with her biological mother. According to court documents filed in the case Monday, Pettway admitted to taking the girl from a Harlem hospital after suffering several miscarriages. \n\nPettway, 49, made an initial appearance in federal court Monday afternoon to face the single kidnapping count. She did not speak or enter a plea during the five-minute hearing. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein ordered her held until a February 7 bail hearing. \n\nShe was dressed in a blue jail uniform and did not look around as she was escorted into the courtroom. In their second-row seats, White's parents leaned forward for a better view of the woman accused of taking their daughter from them more than 23 years ago. \n\nDuring an interview with federal investigators Sunday, Pettway allegedly expressed remorse that she \"caused a lot of pain,\" court papers state. After the hearing, defense attorney Robert Baum said he believed Pettway did express remorse but would not say whether he would challenge her statement to investigators before reading the charging documents. \n\n\"A lot of facts here have yet to come out,\" Baum told reporters. He added, \"She's hopeful that the ending of this tragedy for everyone will shed new light on her role.\" ",

      "story": "1. Penguins Mate for Life During the mid-2000s, films like \"Happy Feet\" made penguins all the rage, and young lovers went around spreading the facts like \"penguins mate for life.\" While the idea is sweet, it's not exactly true. Penguins usually stick with their partners through the mating season, but when it's time to mate again, they choose whomever is convenient, not necessarily their old flame. 2. Vincent Van Gogh Cut Off His Entire Ear This is not entirely true. It was not his entire ear - just the tip of the lobe - and some say he didn't even do it. Van Gogh lived with artist Paul Gauguin, who had quite a violent temper, and many believe Gauguin actually did the cutting. Either way, Van Gogh did reportedly send the tip to a prostitute. 3. Napoleon Bonaparte was Short Everyone knows Napoleon Bonaparte was a tiny man - after all, his nickname was \"le Petit Corporal.\" His reputation for being short even inspired the phenomenon known as the \"Napoleon complex.\" In reality, Napoleon stood around 5 feet and 7 inches tall, which was very average back in the day. Many believe his nickname was meant as a term of endearment, not a reference to his height. 4. Ben Franklin Preferred a Turkey to a Bald Eagle The bald eagle is certainly a well-known representation of America, but legend has it that if Ben Franklin had his way, a turkey would have been much better. In reality, Franklin wrote a letter to his daughter mocking the eagle symbol used in a seal by the Society of the Cincinnati, a private military group. He said it looked like a turkey and may as well be one. 5. You Have Five Senses If you remember learning about the senses in elementary school, you know humans possess five: sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste. Most scientists agree, however, that you have more like 10-20 senses, including pain, hunger, thirst, temperature, and more. 6. George Washington had Wooden Teeth George Washington is known for three things: being the first president, chopping down a cherry tree, and having wooden teeth. At least one of these is certainly not true. While Washington did have bad teeth, his dentures were not wooden. 7. Einstein was a Bad Student If you ever made bad grades and pulled the old \"Albert Einstein used to make bad grades\" card with your parents or teachers, you are lucky you got away with it. In reality, Einstein was at the top of his class and mastered calculus when he was barely a teenager. The reputation he developed for being a bad student had more to do with his behavior. He liked to talk back to his teachers.",

It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. \n\nTypically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave.

Dan, nine, and his seven -year-old brother John, asked \n\n\"I won't be cutting this year,\" my husband Bob said. \"Dan, you and John are old enough to measure things. Do it all by yourselves. Think you boys can handle it? \n\nDan and John seemed to _ in their chairs at the thought of such an amazing responsibility. \"We can handle it.\" Dan promised. \"We won't let you down.\" . \n\nA few days before Christmas. Dan and John rushed in after school. They gathered the tools they'd need and brought them out to the yard .where the tree waited. I was cooking when I heard the happy sounds as the boys carried the tree into the lying room. Then I heard the sound that every mother knows is trouble: dead silence I hurried out to them. The tree was cut too short. John crossed his arms tight across his chest. His eyes filled with angry tears. \n\nI felt worried The tree was central to our holiday. I didn't want the boys to feel ashamed every tune they looked at it. I couldn't lower the ceiling, and I couldn't raise the floor either. There was no way to undo the damage done. Suddenly, a thought came to my mind, which turned the problem into the solution. www..com \n\n\"We can't make the tree taller.\" I said. \"But we can put it on a higher position\" \n\nDan nodded his head sideways. \"We could put it on the coffee table. It just might work! Let's try it!\" \n\nWhen Bob got home and looked at the big tree on top of the coffee table, Dan and John held their breath. \n\n\"What a good idea!\" he declared \"Why didn't I ever think of such a thing?\" \n\nJohn broke into a grin Dan's chest swelled with pride.",

More than 70\u00a0million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. Unresolved rivalries still extant at the end of the conflict contributed to the start of the Second World War only twenty-one years later. \n\nThe war drew in all the world's economic great powers, assembled in two opposing alliances: the Allies (based on the Triple Entente of the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary, it did not join the Central Powers, as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive against the terms of the alliance.

Police say Gonzales quickly became the target of his own cartel. \n\nPolice said Gonzalez knew if his fellow cartel members found him, he would likely be killed, police said. \n\nOn May 15, the cartel found him. \n\nHe was shot eight times outside his home in El Paso, Texas, police said. \n\nPfc.

KENNEDY PUTS HIS FOOT IN IT. \n\nOne morning, about two weeks after Charley's arrival at Red River, Harry Somerville found himself alone in Mr Kennedy's parlour. The old gentleman himself had just galloped away in the direction of the lower fort, to visit Charley, who was now formally installed there; Kate was busy in the kitchen, giving directions about dinner; and Jacques was away with Redfeather, visiting his numerous friends in the settlement: so that, for the first time since his arrival, Harry found himself at the hour of ten in the morning utterly lone, and with nothing very definite to do. Of course, the two weeks that had elapsed were not without their signs and symptoms, their minor accidents and incidents, in regard to the subject that filled his thoughts. Harry had fifty times been tossed alternately from the height of hope to the depth of despair, from the extreme of felicity to the uttermost verge of sorrow, and he began seriously to reflect, when he remembered his desperate resolution on the first night of his arrival, that if he did not \"do\" he certainly would \"die.\" This was quite a mistake, however, on Harry's part. Nobody ever did _die_ of unrequited love. Doubtless many people have hanged, drowned, and shot themselves because of it; but, generally speaking, if the patient can be kept from maltreating himself long enough, _time_ will prove to be an infallible remedy. O youthful reader, lay this to heart; but, pshaw! why do I waste ink on so hopeless a task? _Every_ one, we suppose, resolves once in a way to _die_ of love; so--die away, my young friends, only make sure that you don't _kill_ yourselves, and I've no fear of the result.

That they were filed under the copyist's name, not Franklin's, may explain why they were overlooked by historians until now, said a curator at the British Library, where the letters are held. \n\nThe find is reported in the April issue of the William & Mary Quarterly, a journal of early American history and culture. \n\nThe letters are important in large part because they offer a \"wealth of new details\" that affect modern understanding of Franklin, writes Alan Houston, the political science professor who discovered the letters in the spring of 2007. \n\nThey also raise the question of how many other documents remain waiting to be found on Franklin and his life. \n\nHouston, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, discovered the letters on the last day of his last research trip to London, just before the library's closing time. \n\n\"The first item was a letter from Benjamin Franklin to the secretary of the governor of Maryland, and I looked at it and I started to read, and I thought, 'This doesn't look familiar,'\" Houston told CNN. \"I've read everything Franklin ever wrote.\" ",

Kiraithe did not say what countries the passports were from. \n\nA massive manhunt is under way for Mohammed in Malindi and surrounding areas, \"more intensive than ever before because we wouldn't want to miss him now,\" Kiraithe said. \n\nThe U.S. offers a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his apprehension or conviction. \n\nMohammed has escaped capture and attacks before. Early last year a U.S.-led air strike in Somalia failed to kill him. In 2003, Kenyan police said he escaped authorities. ",

      "story": "Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \"nitrogen\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots \u03bd\u1f30\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"nitre\" and -\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u1fb6\u03bd \"to form\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Greek \u03ac\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds. \n\nNitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. The name comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \"to choke\", directly referencing nitrogen's asphyxiating properties. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dinitrogen, a colourless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula N. Dinitrogen forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the most abundant uncombined element. Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere.",

The Secretary-General serves as the chief administrative officer of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations Secretariat, and of the Secretary-General in particular, is laid out by Chapter\u00a0XV (Articles\u00a097 to 101) of the United Nations Charter. \n\nAs of 2017, the Secretary-General is Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, appointed by the General Assembly on 13 October 2016. \n\nThe Secretary-General was envisioned by U.S. President Franklin D.

According to the UN website, their roles are further defined as \"diplomat and advocate, civil servant, and CEO\". Nevertheless, this more abstract description has not prevented the office holders from speaking out and playing important roles on global issues to various degrees. Article\u00a097 under of the United Nations Charter states that the Secretary-General shall be the \"chief administrative officer\" of the Organization, but does not dictate their specific obligations. \n\nResponsibilities of the Secretary-General are further outlined in Articles\u00a098 through 100. Article\u00a098 states that they shall act as the chief administrative officer \"in all meetings of the General Assembly, of the Security Council, of the Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council, and shall perform other functions as are entrusted to him by these organs\". They are also responsible for making an annual report to the General Assembly. According to Article\u00a099, they may notify the Security Council on matters which \"in their opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security\".

One day he was sitting on the sofa he thought to himself, \"Maybe I'll go for a ride.\" The dog put on his shoes and hat and walked out of the door. He began riding down the street and he saw a lot of funny things. He saw a pumpkin name Sue using toothpaste, a cat name Walt watching a movie and a bear name Phil cooking on a grill. On his drive back home he saw a rat name Randy, and a lion name Leo riding a bike. When the doggy got back home he wanted to write a book about all of the things that he saw. He went into his office and gathered the pen and paper, sat down and began writing. After hours of writing he felt that his leg was hurting from being bent under the table so long. He wrote his last sentence and got up to walk off the pain. The doggy cooked his dinner, ate, then went to bed and the next day he woke up and read his story and liked what he wrote so much that he thought he would write another story later that day.",

      "story": "The corridor windows at the Hangzhou Entel Foreign Language School look a bit different from other schools. They are all decorated with beautiful paper cutting art. But they are not just for decoration. They are also to stop birds from flying into windows. Chen Zitong, 14, a Junior 3 student at the school came up with the idea. In early January, she wrote a letter to the headmaster and suggested this. She often saw birds fly into the clean windows and get hurt. After some online research, she found this solution. \"Some people decorated windows with stickers or posters. Then I thought of replacing them with our traditional paper cutting art,\" Chen said. To Chen's surprise, the headmaster took her advice. The school organized a paper cutting art competition. Students' works that got awards were pasted on the corridor windows. In fact, there have been paper cutting art classes since 2011. \"We have classes once a week for a month to teach paper cutting,\" said Fan Ming, an art teacher. The teaching building even has a display wall to show students' works. Through the class, Shi Jiawei, 14, fell in love with the art of paper cutting. \"It's very fun. I can design my own patterns and present interesting things through it,\" she said. She created many works like bears and magpies . Paper cutting also helps students become more patient. Wang Yiyou, 12, was once an active boy. But now, he can carefully design a delicate paper cutting work with scissors and gravers . \"I am so proud that I can make it look perfect,\" he said.

      "story": "Richard Ben Cramer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer whose 1992 book \"What It Takes\" remains one of the most detailed and passionate of all presidential campaign chronicles, died Monday night, according to his longtime agent, Philippa \"Flip\" Brophy. He was 62. \n\nThe cause of death was lung cancer. \n\nCramer's work -- and work ethic -- was legendary among reporters. He talked in firm, declamatory bursts in a growl of a voice tinged with cigars and alcohol. He was generous with other writers, dogged in his pursuit of information, and known for idiosyncratically \"doing things in his own way, on his own schedule,\" recalled Brophy. \n\n\"He was stubborn, charming and the most brilliant person I knew -- and the warmest,\" she said. \n\n\"He was an unmatched talent who set an enormously high bar for political journalism. I will miss him,\" said Vice President Joe Biden in a statement. Biden and Cramer became friendly when the author was working on \"What It Takes.\" \n\nCNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger, echoing many, attests to his generosity. She was a cub reporter for the old Washington Star when she was assigned to the Maryland statehouse beat. Cramer, then with The (Baltimore) Sun, took her under his wing. \n\n\"I was this new kid on the block, and he'd been around and knew Maryland politics very well, and he was smart and a brilliant writer -- and kind to a new reporter on the beat,\" she said. \n\nCramer put all his fury, emotion and eye for detail on the page in such works as \"Joe DiMaggio: A Hero's Life\" (2000), \"How Israel Lost\" (2004) and especially \"What It Takes,\" a 1,047-page account of the 1988 presidential race.

The republics of Serbia and Montenegro together established a federation in 1992 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY or FR Yugoslavia; \"Savezna Republika Jugoslavija (SFR\" or \"SR Jugoslavija)\" / \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 (\u0421\u0420\u0408 or \u0421\u0420 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430)). \n\nThe FRY aspired to be a sole legal successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but those claims were opposed by other former republics. The United Nations also denied its request to automatically continue the membership of the former state. Eventually, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from power as president of the federation in 2000, the country rescinded those aspirations and accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession. It re-applied for UN membership on 27 October and was admitted on 1 November 2000. \n\nThe FRY was initially dominated by Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as President of Serbia (1989\u20131997) and then President of Yugoslavia (1997\u20132000). Milo\u0161evi\u0107 installed and forced the removal of several federal presidents (such as Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107) and prime ministers (such as Milan Pani\u0107). However, the Montenegrin government, initially enthusiastic supporters of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, started gradually distancing themselves from his policies. That culminated in regime change in 1996, when his former ally Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 reversed his policies, became leader of Montenegro's ruling party and subsequently dismissed former Montenegrin leader Momir Bulatovi\u0107, who remained loyal to the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government. As Bulatovi\u0107 was given central positions in Belgrade from that time (as federal Prime Minister), \u0110ukanovi\u0107 continued to govern Montenegro and further isolated it from Serbia, so that from 1996 to 2006, Montenegro and Serbia were only nominally one country\u2014governance at every feasible level was conducted locally (Belgrade for Serbia and Podgorica for Montenegro).",

Perhaps Tyrrel might know the family, and ask them round to dine some night. At any rate, society is rare at the Lizard. Sooner or later, he felt sure, he'd knock up against the mysterious stranger somewhere. And that involved the probability of knocking up against the mysterious stranger's beautiful daughter. \n\nNext morning after breakfast, however, he made a vigorous effort to induce Walter Tyrrel to mount the cliff and look at the view from Penmorgan Point toward the Rill and Kynance. It was absurd, he said truly, for the proprietor of such an estate never to have seen the most beautiful spot in it. But Tyrrel was obdurate. On the point of actually mounting the cliff itself he wouldn't yield one jot or tittle. Only, after much persuasion, he consented at last to cross the headland by the fields at the back and come out at the tor above St. Michael's Crag, provided always Eustace would promise he'd neither go near the edge himself nor try to induce his friend to approach it. \n\nSatisfied with this lame compromise--for he really wished his host to enjoy that glorious view--Eustace Le Neve turned up the valley behind the house, with Walter Tyrrel by his side, and after traversing several fields, through gaps in the stone walls, led out his companion at last to the tor on the headland.

Typically, the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor. In some cases, Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert. In addition, Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor. \n\nThe current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party, and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader. Unlike the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress. If the Minority Leader's party takes control of the House, and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats, the Minority Leader is usually the party's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress, while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader.

      "story": "Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as with the Senate Majority Leader, the House Majority Leader's duties and prominence vary depending upon the style and power of the Speaker of the House. Typically, the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor. In some cases, Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert. In addition, Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor. \n\nThe current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party, and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader. Unlike the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress. If the Minority Leader's party takes control of the House, and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats, the Minority Leader is usually the party's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress, while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader. The Minority Leader usually meets with the Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues.",

Curtis had just finished his supper and sat drowsily content in his quarters at the police post after being out in the frost all day. The temperature had steadily fallen since morning and the cold was now intensified by a breeze that drove scattered clouds across the moon and flung fine snow against the board walls, but the stove, which glowed a dull red, kept the room comfortable. A nickeled lamp shed down a cheerful light, and the tired corporal looked forward to a long night's rest. Private Stanton sat near him, cleaning a carbine. \n\n\"It's curious you have heard nothing from Regina since you sent up those clothes,\" he remarked. \"It looked pretty bad for Prescott.\" \n\n\"I don't know,\" said Curtis. \"Have you ever seen him with that suit on?\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\n\"Nor has anybody else, so far as I can learn. There's another point--the land agent talked of a tall, stoutish man. You wouldn't call Prescott that.\" \n\n\"Those clothes were 'most as good as new; he might have only had them on the once,\" Stanton persisted. \n\n\"That's what struck me; I don't know how they looked so good, if they'd been lying where Jernyngham found them, since last summer.\" \n\n\"It's a thing I might have thought of.\" \n\n\"You have a good deal to learn yet.\" Curtis smiled tolerantly. \n\n\"Anyhow, I found you a photograph of Prescott, and you were glad to send it along to Regina.

He said the Atkins diet may be more successful because of its simple message to lower the intake of sugar.Also,he said the advice to increase protein in the diet leads to more satisfying meals. \n\nBut last week,another report suggested that only a small minority of people have longterm success in dieting.Researchers at the University of California found that most dieters regained their lost weight within five years.And often they gained back even more.But those who kept the weight off generally were the ones who exercised.",

No more Spitz,no more trouble.\" Francois started to harness the dogs. He needed a new lead-dog, and decided that Solleks was the best dog that he had. But Buck jumped at Solleks and took his place. \"Look at Buck!\" said Francois,laughing. \"He's killed Spitz,and now he wants to be lead-dog.Go away, Buck!\" He pulled Buck away and tried to harness Solleks again.Solleks was unhappy too. He was frightened of Buck, and when Francois turned his back,Buck took Solleks' place again. Now Francois was angry. \"I'll show you! \" he cried,and went to get a heavy club from the sledge. Buck remembered _ ,and moved away. This time,when Solleks was harnessed as lead-dog,Buck did not try to move in.He kept a few meters away and circled around Francois carefully. But when Francois called him to his old place in front of Dave, Buck refused.He had won his fight with Spitz and he wanted to be lead-dog. For an hour the two men tried to harness him.Buck did not run away,but he did not let them catch him.Finally,Francois sat down,and Perrault looked at his watch.It was getting late. The two men looked at one another and smiled. Francois walked up to Solleks,took off his harness, led him back and harnessed him in his old place.Then he called Buck. All the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was now the one at the front. But Buck did not move. \"Put down the club,\" said Perrault. Francois dropped the club, and immediately Buck came up to the front of the team.Francois harnessed him, and in a minute the sledge was moving. Buck was an excellent leader. He moved and thought quickly and led the other dogs well. A new leader made no difference to Dave and Solleks; they continued to pull hard.But the other dogs had had an easy life when Spitz was leading.They were surprised when Buck made them work hard and punished them for their mistakes. Pike,the second dog,was usually lazy;but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever pulled in his life. The first night in camp Buck fought Joe,another difficult dog,and after that there were no more problems with him.The team started to pull together,and to move faster and faster. \"I've never seen a dog like Buck!\" cried Francois, \"Never! He's worth a thousand dollars. What do you think, Perrault? \" Perrault agreed.They were moving quickly,and covering more ground every day. The snow was good and hard,and no new snow fell.The temperature dropped to 45degC below zero, and didn't change.

The wind soon blew itself out, but the day broke cloudy and dripping, and when the little party assembled at breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the change of weather. Nance had been brooding on the scene at the river-side, applying it in various ways to her particular aspirations, and the result, which was hardly to her mind, had taken the colour out of her cheeks. Mr. Archer, too, was somewhat absent, his thoughts were of a mingled strain; and even upon his usually impassive countenance there were betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of exultation, which the girl translated in terms of her own hopes and fears. But Jonathan was the most altered: he was strangely silent, hardly passing a word, and watched Mr. Archer with an eager and furtive eye. It seemed as if the idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more solid shape, and, while it still attracted, somewhat alarmed his imagination. \n\nAt this rate, conversation languished into a silence which was only broken by the gentle and ghostly noises of the rain on the stone roof and about all that field of ruins; and they were all relieved when the note of a man whistling and the sound of approaching footsteps in the grassy court announced a visitor. It was the ostler from the \"Green Dragon\" bringing a letter for Mr. Archer. Nance saw her hero's face contract and then relax again at sight of it; and she thought that she knew why, for the sprawling, gross black characters of the address were easily distinguishable from the fine writing on the former letter that had so much disturbed him. He opened it and began to read; while the ostler sat down to table with a pot of ale, and proceeded to make himself agreeable after his fashion. ",

      "story": "A nonprofit organization (NPO, also known as a non-business entity) is an organization whose purposes are other than making a profit. A nonprofit organization is often dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a particular point of view. In economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends. This is known as the distribution constraint. The decision to adopt a nonprofit legal structure is one that will often have taxation implications, particularly where the nonprofit seeks income tax exemption, charitable status and so on. \n\nThe nonprofit landscape is highly varied, although many people have come to associate NPOs with charitable organizations. Although charities do comprise an often high profile or visible aspect of the sector, there are many other types of nonprofits. Overall, they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving organizations include mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and peak bodies \u2013 organizations that benefit a particular group of people i.e. the members of the organization. Typically, community-serving organizations are focused on providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally: organizations delivering human services programs or projects, aid and development programs, medical research, education and health services, and so on. It could be argued many nonprofits sit across both camps, at least in terms of the impact they make. For example, the grassroots support group that provides a lifeline to those with a particular condition or disease could be deemed to be serving both its members (by directly supporting them) and the broader community (through the provision of a helping service for fellow citizens).",

      "story": "(Health.com) -- Middle-aged men who take steps to improve their heart health by eating better, getting more exercise, or taking cholesterol-lowering drugs may end up improving their sex lives as well, according to a new analysis of existing research. \n\nNearly 1 in 5 men in the U.S. has difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection, a condition known as erectile dysfunction (ED). The new study, which appears this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine, suggests that ED drugs such as Viagra aren't the only solution and aren't always enough to address the problem, says coauthor Dr. Stephen Kopecky, M.D., a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \n\n\"If you do take care of your lifestyle\u2014eating right, exercising, losing weight\u2014you respond much better to the Viagra, the Levitra, the Cialis,\" Kopecky says. By the same token, he adds, if these drugs become less effective \"that should be a sign that...you need to take care of your lifestyle.'\" \n\nHealth.com: 7 ways to treat erectile dysfunction \n\nED is troubling enough by itself, but to make matters worse it's also a known harbinger of heart disease. The arteries in the penis that expand during an erection can become weakened and clogged with cholesterol in the same way as the arteries that surround the heart. This is why ED often shows up three to five years ahead of life-threatening cardiovascular problems such as heart attack or stroke, especially in younger men, Kopecky says. \n\n\"The common denominator is blood flow,\" he explains. \"If you look at a guy in his 40s who has erectile dysfunction and then you compare [him] to another guy in his 40s who doesn't have erectile dysfunction, the guy with ED is about 50 times more likely to have heart disease.\" ",

She had broken actually every long bone in her body, along with her pelvis, jaw, and cheekbones. He was terrified his bride would bleed to death. \n\nStephen and Shelli had married just six months before near their home in South Jordan, Utah. They were in Hawaii on a family vacation with two of their sons. The family had rented electric motors and headed towards a nature preserve near Waikiki. But Shelli had fallen behind and the family turned back to make sure she was okay. \n\nShelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital. Physicians were able to make her come to herself. On the first and second days there, she lived through half a dozen operations. On day three, the worst of Stephen's fears came true. Shelli didn't wake. She had shown heart failure and lung failure. \"I thought every heartbeat would be her last,\" Stephen says. \n\nAs days passed with no change, one doctor gently asked if it was time to let Shelli go. An MRI showed her brain didn't have much chance of supporting life. Stephen couldn't bear the thought of trapping his wife's beautiful spirit in a body that would never work. If he kept her alive, what kind of life would she have ? He called family, religious leaders, and physician friends in Utah for guidance. \n\nAnd he decided there still was a chance. \n\nThe family moved Shelli to a Utah hospital closer to home. In the next few weeks she started opening her eyes, but it wasn't entirely clear how conscious she was. Nearly seven weeks after the accident, Stephen was joking with his sister in the hospital room when he saw Shelli smile, a big toothy grin. \"Did you understand that?\" he asked. She smiled again. Stephen fell to his knees in thanks. \n\nShelli's recovery has been slow but steady. Initially, she couldn't remember much of the previous months, including her own wedding. Shelli has endured 17 operations so far and may require more surgery. She will definitely need more months of recovery. But she is able to walk. \"She's got her life back. She's able to love and be loved, and be the person she was.\" Elovie says. \n\nWhen Shelli hears about each step in her recovery, she calls it \"miracle after miracle\". As for his experience, Stephen says, \"This is a story of fear that was slowly replaced by faith.\"",

Since 1987, it has been one of New Zealand's official languages. It is closely related to Cook Islands M\u0101ori, Tuamotuan, and Tahitian. \n\nA national census undertaken in 2013 reported that about 148,000 people, or 3.7% of the New Zealand population, could hold a conversation in M\u0101ori about everyday things. , 55% of M\u0101ori adults reported some knowledge of the language; of these speakers, 64% use M\u0101ori at home and 50,000 can speak the language \"very well\" or \"well\". \n\nThere was originally no native writing system for M\u0101ori. Missionaries brought the Latin alphabet around 1814, and linguist Samuel Lee worked with chief Hongi Hika to systematize the written language in 1820. The resultant phonetic spellings were remarkably successful. Written M\u0101ori has changed little since then. \n\nThe English word comes from the M\u0101ori language, where it is spelled \"M\u0101ori\". In New Zealand, the M\u0101ori language is commonly referred to as \"Te Reo\" \"the language\", short for \"te reo M\u0101ori\". \n\nThe spelling \"Maori\" (without macron) is standard in English outside New Zealand in both general and linguistic usage. The M\u0101ori-language spelling \"M\u0101ori\" (with macron) has become common in New Zealand English in recent years, particularly in M\u0101ori-specific cultural contexts, although the traditional English spelling is still prevalent in general media and government use.",

He has released some political prisoners. He sent New Year's greetings to Jews in Iran and around the world. He took a phone call from the president of the United States. \n\nDoes any of this portend real change in Iran? \n\nThe case for skepticism is strong. None of the regime has changed in any way. Iran continues to make mischief through the region, most horrifically by supporting the brutal actions of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. As far as anyone can tell, Iran pursues nuclear weapons as determinedly as ever. \n\nRouhani himself is no liberal and no Democrat. An early supporter of the Ayatollah Khomeini, Rouhani held senior positions in the Iranian state during the regime's most vicious period of international terrorism, the early 1990s - the years in which Iranian-backed terrorists carried out assassinations in Berlin and Paris and carried out two terrible bombings of Jewish targets in Buenos Aires, killing 114 people and wounding nearly a thousand more. \n\nAs Iran's chief nuclear negotiator in the 2000s, Rouhani nimbly evaded international efforts to achieve a peaceful end to the country's drive for weapons of mass death. \n\nMore fundamentally, the president of Iran does not govern the country's national security system. The military and the secret police answer to the supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khameini, who has very emphatic geopolitical ideas of his own.

The republics of Serbia and Montenegro together established a federation in 1992 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY or FR Yugoslavia; \"Savezna Republika Jugoslavija (SFR\" or \"SR Jugoslavija)\" / \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 (\u0421\u0420\u0408 or \u0421\u0420 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430)). \n\nThe FRY aspired to be a sole legal successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but those claims were opposed by other former republics. The United Nations also denied its request to automatically continue the membership of the former state. Eventually, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from power as president of the federation in 2000, the country rescinded those aspirations and accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession. It re-applied for UN membership on 27 October and was admitted on 1 November 2000. \n\nThe FRY was initially dominated by Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as President of Serbia (1989\u20131997) and then President of Yugoslavia (1997\u20132000). Milo\u0161evi\u0107 installed and forced the removal of several federal presidents (such as Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107) and prime ministers (such as Milan Pani\u0107). However, the Montenegrin government, initially enthusiastic supporters of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, started gradually distancing themselves from his policies. That culminated in regime change in 1996, when his former ally Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 reversed his policies, became leader of Montenegro's ruling party and subsequently dismissed former Montenegrin leader Momir Bulatovi\u0107, who remained loyal to the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government. As Bulatovi\u0107 was given central positions in Belgrade from that time (as federal Prime Minister), \u0110ukanovi\u0107 continued to govern Montenegro and further isolated it from Serbia, so that from 1996 to 2006, Montenegro and Serbia were only nominally one country\u2014governance at every feasible level was conducted locally (Belgrade for Serbia and Podgorica for Montenegro).",

The founder of this empire was Cyrus the Great. He was originally a Persian; and the whole empire is often called the Persian monarchy, taking its name from its founder's native land. \n\nCyrus was not contented with having annexed to his dominion all the civilized states of Asia. In the latter part of his life, he conceived the idea that there might possibly be some additional glory and power to be acquired in subduing certain half-savage regions in the north, beyond the Araxes. He accordingly raised an army, and set off on an expedition for this purpose, against a country which was governed by a barbarian queen named Tomyris. He met with a variety of adventures on this expedition, all of which are fully detailed in our history of Cyrus. There is, however, only one occurrence that it is necessary to allude to particularly here. That one relates to a remarkable dream which he had one night, just after he had crossed the river. ",

Firstly, Jay bought a plane ticket and took a trip to Columbus, Ohio, USA, thinking that he would start by working his way across the USA from East to West. On his first day he was inside a church taking photos when he noticed a golden telephone on the wall with a sign that read \"$10,000 per call\". Jay was _ so he asked a priest what the telephone was used for. The priest told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 you could talk to God. Jay thanked the priest and went along his way. Next stop was in Des Moines, and there at a very large church, he saw the same looking golden telephone with the same sign under it. A nearby nun told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 he could talk to God. Jay decided to travel to Australia to see if they had a similar phone. He arrived at Western Australia, and again, in the church he entered, there was the same looking golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read \"40 cents per call.\" Somewhat surprised, Jay asked the priest about the sign. 'Father Brian, I travelled all over the world and I saw this same golden telephone in many churches. I know it is a direct line to Heaven, but in all of them price was $10,000 per call. Why is it so cheap here?' Father Brian smiled and answered, 'My son, you're in Australia now - this is Heaven, so it's only a local call.'",

Two others, including current Auburn sophomore offensive lineman Eric Mack, 20, of Cameron, South Carolina, were taken to East Alabama Medical Center in the nearby town of Opelika. \n\nMack was released from the medical center about 11 a.m. Sunday after being treated for a gunshot wound, hospital spokesman John Atkinson said. \n\nDawson said 20-year-old John Robertson was in critical condition and undergoing surgery Sunday at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital. Robertson was shot in the head, Dawson said. \n\nA third man, 19-year-old Xavier Moss, was treated and released from East Alabama Medical Center. Both Moss and Robertson are from Roanoke, Alabama, authorities said. \n\nPolice have a motive in the shooting, but Dawson would not release it, saying \"that's for the courtroom, later on.\" ",

Everything was new to him; the architecture of the churches and villages, the dress of the people, their modes of agriculture, all differing widely from those to which he was accustomed. In some villages the Catholics predominated, and here the passage of the little party was regarded with frowning brows and muttered threats; by the Huguenots they were saluted respectfully, and if they halted, many questions were asked their followers as to news about the intentions of the court, the last rumours as to the attitude of Conde, and the prospects of a continuance of peace. \n\nHere, too, great respect was paid to Marie and Philip when it was known they were relatives of the Countess de Laville, and belonged to the family of the De Moulins. Emilie had for some time been a widow--the count, her husband, having fallen at the battle of Dreux, at the end of the year 1562--but being an active and capable woman, she had taken into her hands the entire management of the estates, and was one of the most influential among the Huguenot nobles of that part of the country. \n\nFrom their last halting place, Marie Vaillant sent on a letter by one of the men to her sister, announcing their coming. She had written on her landing at La Rochelle, and they had been met on their way by a messenger from the countess, expressing her delight that her sister had at last carried out her promise to visit her, and saying that Francois was looking eagerly for the coming of his cousin.

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. \n\nThe composition of a genus is determined by a taxonomist. The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera. There are some general practices used, however, including the idea that a newly defined genus should fulfill these three criteria to be descriptively useful: \n\nMoreover, genera should be composed of phylogenetic units of the same kind as other (analogous) genera. \n\nThe term comes from the Latin ' (\"origin; type; group; race\"), a noun form cognate with ' (\"to bear; to give birth to\"). Linnaeus popularized its use in his 1753 \"Species Plantarum\", but the French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656\u20131708) is considered \"the founder of the modern concept of genera\". \n\nThe scientific name of a genus may be called the generic name or generic epithet: it is always capitalized. It plays a pivotal role in binomial nomenclature, the system of naming organisms.",

But while a source familiar with Jeffs' condition told CNN Monday that the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was in a coma, Clark said Tuesday that Jeffs was conscious. \n\n\"He's somewhat sedated, but he is responsive,\" Clark wrote. \n\nAnd Michelle Lyons, another press officer for the department, said Jeffs \"is expected to make a full recovery.\" Lyons said that in addition to not eating, he had \"bigger issues that required medical attention.\" \n\nPrison officials have not elaborated on those conditions, citing inmate privacy rules. \n\nJeffs was convicted in early August of the aggravated sexual assaults of a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old girl he claimed were his \"spiritual wives.\" His church is a breakaway Mormon sect that practices polygamy, which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago. \n\nJeffs was sent to a hospital in Tyler on Sunday night and was in critical but stable condition Tuesday. He told officials at the Powledge prison unit that he was not on a hunger strike, but had been \"fasting,\" Clark said. \n\n\"While he definitely is eating and drinking some, it just wasn't as much as he should,\" Clark said.

This morning, however, she met nobody and heard only the sounds of animals. Some time later, Andi got to the steep slope , she climbed up to the top by using her hands. When she finally reached the top, she noticed a dark shape several inches from her left foot. She was frightened and then looked carefully. \"It's a dog and it's dead.\" she said to herself. It took her a few seconds to realize that the dog's eyes were open. A thin, dirty bull dog was looking at her. She greeted in a low and soft voice to show she was friendly. The bull dog shook when he heard her voice. Andi inched closer and dropped some water into the dog's mouth. He tried to stand up but failed. Something was wrong with his left front leg. Andi pulled out her phone to contact her husband, Jason, but he didn't _ . She knew that if she didn't carry the dog down the mountain, he would die. She carefully put her arms under the dog's body. He was so weak that he fell into her chest. Andi had great trouble going down the steep, rocky mountainside with the 50-pound animal in her arms. Even her arms and back started aching, she didn't give up. The trip up had taken 30 minutes while going back down took twice that. Andi's husband received her messages at last. He and their son, Justin, jumped into the car and drove to pick up Andi. Later that morning, an X-ray showed that the bull dog was badly hurt, he was likely to lose his left leg. A few days later, the Davises returned to the animal hospital. \"The first thing he did was to give me a kiss, then he went right to my son.\" Andi said. They named the dog Elijah and brought him home that day.",

Jay was _ so he asked a priest what the telephone was used for. The priest told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 you could talk to God. Jay thanked the priest and went along his way. Next stop was in Des Moines, and there at a very large church, he saw the same looking golden telephone with the same sign under it. A nearby nun told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 he could talk to God. Jay decided to travel to Australia to see if they had a similar phone. He arrived at Western Australia, and again, in the church he entered, there was the same looking golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read \"40 cents per call.\" Somewhat surprised, Jay asked the priest about the sign. 'Father Brian, I travelled all over the world and I saw this same golden telephone in many churches. I know it is a direct line to Heaven, but in all of them price was $10,000 per call. Why is it so cheap here?' Father Brian smiled and answered, 'My son, you're in Australia now - this is Heaven, so it's only a local call.'",

The neighbourhood of the Welleses at Brambridge probably moved him to make this condition. \n\nThe person who applied for the lease was Dr. John Young, Dean of Winchester, who purchased the copyhold of Cranbury before 1643, and retired thither when he was expelled from his deanery and other preferments in the evil times of the Commonwealth, and there died, leaving his widow in possession. \n\nWhether the lady was molested by Mr. Maijor we do not know. He was no favourite with Richard Morley, who rented the forge in Hursley, the farm of Ratlake and Anvyle, as Ampfield was then spelt, and thought him a severe lord to his copyholders. Morley was born at Hursley, and was sent to school at Baddesley in 1582, the year of the great hailstorm of the nine-inch stones. He kept valuable memoranda, which Mr. Marsh quotes, and died in 1672, when he is registered as:- ",

Renamed \"Kings-town upon Hull\" by King Edward I in 1299, Hull has been a market town, military supply port, trading hub, fishing and whaling centre and industrial metropolis. \n\nHull was an early theatre of battle in the English Civil Wars. Its 18th century Member of Parliament, William Wilberforce, took a prominent part in the abolition of the slave trade in Britain. \n\nThe city is unique in the UK in having had a municipally owned telephone system from 1902, sporting cream, not red, telephone boxes. \n\nAfter suffering heavy damage in the Second World War (the 'Hull Blitz'), Hull weathered a period of post-industrial decline, gaining unfavourable results on measures of social deprivation, education and policing.

Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast and Yemen to the south. It is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba.

He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamic lines.

      "story": "Buckingham Palace has a history that dates back over 500 years and has changed hands on numerous occasions, however, much of the building that remains standing today is from the original structure built in the early 1700's. \n\nIn the beginning Buckingham Palace was originally known as Buckingham House. However, in 1762 George III liked the house so much that he bought it for 28,000 and renamed it \"The Queen's House\". The reason for this was down to the fact that he bought the house to give to his wife Charlotte. Shortly after he did this, work soon began in order to remodel the house with the help of Sir William Chambers. This trend then continued with the accession of George IV in 1820 when he decided to reconstruct the house but he still used it for the same purpose that his father did. \n\nOne of the biggest physical changes to the house occurred several years later when the king had a change of mind. It was in 1826 that King George IV set about transforming the house into what it is known today, Buckingham Palace. He did this with the help of an architect known as John Nash. \n\nThe work that Nash carried out involved doubling the size of the main block through adding a new suite of rooms on the garden side facing the west. He then faced this with mellow Bath stone, which reflected the French neo-classical influence favored by George IV. Many of the rooms that Nash added still remain pretty much unchanged today. \n\nThe palace as it stands today acts as not only the London residence of Her Majesty the Queen but also the administrative headquarters of the Royal Household. It is in fact one of the few working royal palaces that remain in the world today. The state rooms are extensively used by the Queen as well as members of the royal family as a way of receiving and entertaining guests on state, ceremonial and official occasions.",

      "story": "Found in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives, electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as from the power grid, inverters or generators. Small motors may be found in electric watches. General-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest of electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on. \n\nPerhaps the first electric motors were simple electrostatic devices created by the Scottish monk Andrew Gordon in the 1740s. The theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field, Amp\u00e8re's force law, was discovered later by Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1820. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, brine substituting for toxic mercury. Though Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Gordon Stoker, who as part of the vocal group the Jordanaires sang backup on hits by Elvis Presley, Patsy Cline, George Jones and countless others, died Wednesday at his home in Brentwood, Tennessee. He was 88. \n\nHis death was confirmed by the group's website. \n\nFor many years, the Jordanaires were Elvis' go-to backup singers, performing on hits including \"Hound Dog,\" \"Are You Lonesome Tonight\" and \"Crying in the Chapel.\" \n\nThe group also supported Patsy Cline on \"Crazy,\" Jim Reeves on \"Four Walls,\" Kenny Rogers on \"Lucille\" and Jones on \"He Stopped Loving Her Today.\" \n\nOn their own, they generally stuck to gospel, releasing more than a dozen albums over the course of several decades. \n\nThe group met Presley after a performance with Eddy Arnold in 1955. According to a much-told story, after the show the then-unknown Elvis told the group that, if he ever landed a major-label contract -- he was on Memphis' Sun Records at the time -- he'd have the Jordanaires back him up. After Presley joined RCA in 1956, he was true to his word. The group sang with him on both recordings and in concert for the next 14 years. \n\nStoker wasn't an original member of the group, which formed in Springfield, Missouri, in the 1940s. He was hired as its piano player in 1950 and only became a vocalist later -- staying for more than 60 years, generally as its lead tenor. \n\n\"As a longtime member of the vocal quartet the Jordanaires, he helped to influence the sound of gospel, country and pop music with a unique and versatile style while recording with an impressive roster of artists,\" said the Recording Academy in a statement. \"We have lost a gifted and timeless artist who made significant contributions to music and our industry.\" ",

He accordingly raised an army, and set off on an expedition for this purpose, against a country which was governed by a barbarian queen named Tomyris. He met with a variety of adventures on this expedition, all of which are fully detailed in our history of Cyrus.

This was in 1638, and for some time the lodge at Hursley was lent to Mr. Kingswell, Mr. Maijor's father-in-law, who died there in 1639, after which time Mr. Maijor took up his abode there. He seems to have been a shrewd, active man, and a staunch Protestant, for when there was a desire to lease out Cranbury, he, as Lord of the Manor, stipulated that it should be let only to a Protestant of the Church of England, not to a Papist. The neighbourhood of the Welleses at Brambridge probably moved him to make this condition. \n\nThe person who applied for the lease was Dr. John Young, Dean of Winchester, who purchased the copyhold of Cranbury before 1643, and retired thither when he was expelled from his deanery and other preferments in the evil times of the Commonwealth, and there died, leaving his widow in possession. \n\nWhether the lady was molested by Mr. Maijor we do not know. He was no favourite with Richard Morley, who rented the forge in Hursley, the farm of Ratlake and Anvyle, as Ampfield was then spelt, and thought him a severe lord to his copyholders. Morley was born at Hursley, and was sent to school at Baddesley in 1582, the year of the great hailstorm of the nine-inch stones.

He was the first Chinese official to referee at a World Cup, when South Korea and Japan hosted the showpiece event in 2002. \n\nPrior to that he had taken charge of matches at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and was twice voted referee of the year by the Asian Football Confederation. \n\nBut the court in the city of Dandong, near the border with North Korea, found that Lu had altered the outcome of seven games that involved four clubs including Shanghai Shenhua, who have just signed former France striker Nicolas Anelka from English club Chelsea. \n\nHuang was convicted of accepting $247,975 from seven separate cases while $31,760 of his personal assets were also confiscated.

Being the son of a famous surfer, Jack naturally has an interest in surfing. Most of his life lessons were learned in the water. At the age of 17, Jack entered the finals of the Pineline Masters---the world's most famous surfing competition. Everyone thought Jack would become a professional surfer like his father. Unluckily, one month later, he had a deadly accident while surfing and was seriously hurt. Life is like a revolving door. When it closes, it also opens. Jack started to practice playing the guitar and write songs when he was staying in hospital. At first, his father thought Jack only did it for fun, but soon he was surprised at the great progress his son had made. When studying in the university, Jack didn't stop practicing his guitar skills. He played the guitar for school parties. He wrote songs and sang for his teachers and friends. They liked his songs. His first music album Brushfire Fairytalescame out in 2001. It was a great success. His second album,On and On, was much like his first one. They were filled with sweet, easy-going songs that everybody liked listening to. Later, Jack had lots of concerts in and out of America. He became popular all over the world. Jack had five albums by 2010 and more than 15 million copies of them were sold. His music doesn't fit into any of the popular music styles like pop, rock, R&B or hip-hop. It is more like fold music, played with a guitar and beautiful voice. When listening to his songs, you feel like lying on the beach enjoying the warm sunshine. Jack is a talent, though he himself says he is only a surfer who loves music. In his songs we can find his secret of success: Whatever happens in our lives, we have to accept it and do the best we can.",

The word \"Real\" is Spanish for \"Royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (\"socios\") have owned and operated the club throughout its history. \n\nThe club was estimated to be worth \u20ac3.24\u00a0billion ($3.65\u00a0billion) in 2015, and in the 2014\u201315 season it was the world's highest-earning football club, with an annual revenue of \u20ac577\u00a0million. The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world. Real Madrid is one of three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably \"El Cl\u00e1sico\" with Barcelona and \"El Derbi\" with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. \n\nReal Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s, winning five consecutive European Cups and reaching the final seven times. This success was replicated in the league, where the club won five times in the space of seven years. This team, which consisted of players such as Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Francisco Gento and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.",

The district has the 10th-largest population in England, while the Bristol metropolitan area is the 12th-largest in the United Kingdom. The city borders North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively. \n\nIron Age hill forts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the rivers Frome and Avon, and around the beginning of the 11th century the settlement was known as Brycgstow (Old English \"the place at the bridge\"). Bristol received a royal charter in 1155 and was historically divided between Gloucestershire and Somerset until 1373, when it became a county of itself. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities after London in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool in the Industrial Revolution. \n\nBristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.",

      "story": "Matt Haimovitz is 42 and a renowned cellist in the world. He rushed into the classical music scene at the age of 12 after Itzhak Perlman, the famed violinist, heard him play. But nothing in his family history explains where Haimovitz got his extraordinary talent. And that's typical, Ellen Winner, a professor says. \"People are fascinated by these children because they don't understand where their talent came from. You will see parents who say, 'I wasn't like this, and my husband wasn't like this.' It seems to sometimes just come out of the blue,\" Winner says. It's not clear whether a prodigy's brain is any different from the brains of other children, in part because there have been no study comparing the brains of prodigies to those of average people. \"But I believe that anything that shows up so early, without training, has got to be either a genetic or some other biological basis,\" Winner says. \"If a child suddenly at the age of 3 goes to the piano and picks out a tune and does it beautifully, that has to be because that child has a different brain.\" Children who are extremely gifted tend to be socially different, too, Winner says. \"They feel like they can't find other kids like themselves, so they feel strange, maybe even like a freak, and feel like they don't have anybody to connect with. On the other hand, they also long to connect with other kids, and they can't find other kids like themselves.\" As Haimovitz got older, he became frustrated. He wanted to play other kinds of music but felt constricted by the image and the expectations of the boy prodigy who played classical music and filled concert halls. \"When you start that early, you suddenly start to grow up in public, and I wanted to experiment,\" Haimovitz says. So he took his cello into punk rock clubs and coffee houses. He played Bach, Haydn and Hendrix. \"My teacher was Leonard Rose, and we never played any 20th-century music. He didn't like it. But once I was exposed to James Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix, Miles Dewey Davis El and others, I couldn't really turn back. I wanted to know more,\" he says.",

There was to be a good deal of dancing, and before it had gone very far, Marian Almond came up to Catherine, in company with a tall young man. She introduced the young man as a person who had a great desire to make our heroine's acquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur Townsend, her own intended. \n\nMarian Almond was a pretty little person of seventeen, with a very small figure and a very big sash, to the elegance of whose manners matrimony had nothing to add. She already had all the airs of a hostess, receiving the company, shaking her fan, saying that with so many people to attend to she should have no time to dance. She made a long speech about Mr. Townsend's cousin, to whom she administered a tap with her fan before turning away to other cares. Catherine had not understood all that she said; her attention was given to enjoying Marian's ease of manner and flow of ideas, and to looking at the young man, who was remarkably handsome. She had succeeded, however, as she often failed to do when people were presented to her, in catching his name, which appeared to be the same as that of Marian's little stockbroker. Catherine was always agitated by an introduction; it seemed a difficult moment, and she wondered that some people--her new acquaintance at this moment, for instance-- should mind it so little. She wondered what she ought to say, and what would be the consequences of her saying nothing. The consequences at present were very agreeable. Mr. Townsend, leaving her no time for embarrassment, began to talk with an easy smile, as if he had known her for a year. ",

There was a latent unwillingness in Mrs. Egremont's mind to discuss the subject with either aunt or daughter; and when the post brought no letter, Ursula, after a moment's sense of flatness, was relieved, and returned to her eager desire to hurry after the water-soldier. It was feasible that very afternoon. Mary Nugent came in with the intelligence. \n\n'And can Gerard come? or we shall only look at it.' \n\n'Yes, Gerard can come, and so will Mr. Dutton,' said Mary, who, standing about half-way between Mrs. Egremont and her daughter, did not think herself quite a sufficient chaperon. \n\n'He will look on like a hen at her ducklings,' said Nuttie. 'It is cruel to take him, poor man!' \n\n'Meantime, Nuttie, do you like an hour of \"Marie Stuart?\"' \n\n'Oh, thank you!' But she whispered, 'Aunt Ursel, may I tell her?' \n\n'Ask your mother, my dear.' \n\nLeave was given, half reluctantly, and with a prohibition against mentioning the subject to any one else, but both mother and aunt had confidence in Mary Nugent's wisdom and discretion, so the two friends sat on the wall together, and Ursula poured out her heart. Poor little girl! she was greatly discomfited at the vanishing of her noble vision of the heroic self-devoted father, and ready on the other hand to believe him a villain, like Bertram Risingham, or 'the Pirate,' being possessed by this idea on account of his West Indian voyages. At any rate, she was determined not to be accepted or acknowledged without her mother, and was already rehearsing magnanimous letters of refusal. ",

      "story": "Materialism is a form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all phenomena, including mental phenomena and consciousness, are identical with material interactions. \n\nMaterialism is closely related to physicalism, the view that all that exists is ultimately physical. Philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the discoveries of the physical sciences to incorporate more sophisticated notions of physicality than mere ordinary matter, such as: spacetime, physical energies and forces, dark matter, and so on. Thus the term \"physicalism\" is preferred over \"materialism\" by some, while others use the terms as if they are synonymous. \n\nMaterialism belongs to the class of monist ontology. As such, it is different from ontological theories based on dualism or pluralism. For singular explanations of the phenomenal reality, materialism would be in contrast to idealism, neutral monism, and spiritualism. \n\nDespite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many, all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, which are defined in contrast to each other: Idealism, and materialism.[a] The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality, and the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions: \"what does reality consist of?\" and \"how does it originate?\" To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind (ideas) are primary, and matter secondary. To materialists, matter is primary, and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary, the product of matter acting upon matter.",

The district has the 10th-largest population in England, while the Bristol metropolitan area is the 12th-largest in the United Kingdom. The city borders North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively. \n\nIron Age hill forts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the rivers Frome and Avon, and around the beginning of the 11th century the settlement was known as Brycgstow (Old English \"the place at the bridge\"). Bristol received a royal charter in 1155 and was historically divided between Gloucestershire and Somerset until 1373, when it became a county of itself. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities after London in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool in the Industrial Revolution. \n\nBristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World.

He had not received the money as the ruling was under appeal. \n\nHeinze was found dead August 29 in his Brunswick mobile home along with six others. An eighth person died later at a hospital. \n\nPolice said all of the victims died from \"blunt force trauma,\" but they did not provide any further details. \n\nHeinze's son, Guy Heinze Jr., 22, faces eight counts of first-degree murder in the deaths. Police suspect he acted alone, according to a statement from the Glynn County Police Department. \n\nThe younger Heinze has made his initial court appearance via closed-circuit television from the Glynn County Detention Center, his attorney, Ron Harrison, said Tuesday. His preliminary hearing likely will come next week, Harrison said. \n\nThe elder Heinze told relatives about the award days before his death, family members said. Court officials said the ruling was issued August 11, and an appeal was filed six days later. \n\nHarrison said he was aware of the award in the lawsuit but would not comment on it. \n\nPolice also are aware of it, Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said, but he declined comment on whether it is being explored as a possible motive in the slayings.

Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km2, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. \n\nThe oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland, Ireland and North Wales and are 2,700 million years old.

The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards. Ben Nevis rises to an elevation of only 1,344 metres (4,409 ft), and Lough Neagh, which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles, covers 390 square kilometres (151 sq mi).

Fray's forehead was wrinkled both perpendicularly and crosswise, after the pattern of a portcullis, expressive of a double despair. Laban Tall's lips were thin, and his face was rigid. Matthew's jaws sank, and his eyes turned whichever way the strongest muscle happened to pull them. \n\n\"Yes,\" said Joseph, \"and I was sitting at home, looking for Ephesians, and says I to myself, ''Tis nothing but Corinthians and Thessalonians in this danged Testament,' when who should come in but Henery there: 'Joseph,' he said, 'the sheep have blasted theirselves--'\" ",

The tidings, of course, were told to Mr. Caldigate, and were then made known by him to Hester. The old man, though he turned the matter much in his mind,--doubting whether the hopes thus raised would not add to Hester's sorrow should they not ultimately be realised,--decided that he could not keep her in the dark. Her belief could not be changed by any statement which Shand might make. Her faith was so strong that no evidence could shake it,--or confirm it. But there would, no doubt, arise in her mind a hope of liberation if any new evidence against the Australian marriage were to reach her; which hope might so probably be delusive! But he knew her to be strong to endure as well as strong to hope, and therefore he told her at once. Then Mr. Seely returned to Cambridge, and all the facts of Shand's deposition were made known at Folking. 'That will get him out at once, of course,' said Hester, triumphantly, as soon as she heard it. But the Squire was older and more cautious, and still doubted. He explained that Dick Shand was not a man who by his simple word would certainly convince a Secretary of State;--that deceit might be suspected;--that a fraudulent plot would be possible; and that very much care was necessary before a convicted prisoner would be released. \n\n'I am quite sure, from Mr. Seely's manner, that he thinks I have bribed the young man,' said Caldigate.

It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time, and covered more than 13,000,000 sq mi (33,670,000 km2), almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \"the empire on which the sun never sets\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.",

A member of the Republican Party, he was previously a congressman, ambassador, and Director of Central Intelligence. He is the oldest living former President and Vice President. Previously known as simply \"George Bush\", since 2001, Bush has often been referred to as \"George H. W. Bush\", \"Bush 41\", \"Bush the Elder\", or \"George Bush Senior\" to distinguish him from his eldest son, George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States. \n\nBush was born in Milton, Massachusetts, to Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the U.S. Navy on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest aviator in the U.S. Navy at the time. He served until the end of the war, then attended Yale University. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to West Texas and entered the oil business, becoming a millionaire by the age of 40. Bush became involved in politics soon after founding his own oil company, and he won election to the House of Representatives in 1966. In 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Bush as Ambassador to the United Nations, and in 1973, Bush became the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. The following year, President Gerald Ford appointed Bush as the ambassador to the People's Republic of China, and later reassigned Bush to the position of Director of Central Intelligence. Bush ran for president in 1980 but was defeated in the Republican primary by Ronald Reagan. Reagan chose Bush as his running mate, and Bush became vice president after the Reagan\u2013Bush ticket won the 1980 election. During his eight-year tenure as vice president, Bush headed administration task forces on deregulation and fighting the \"War on Drugs\".",

There was to be a good deal of dancing, and before it had gone very far, Marian Almond came up to Catherine, in company with a tall young man. She introduced the young man as a person who had a great desire to make our heroine's acquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur Townsend, her own intended. \n\nMarian Almond was a pretty little person of seventeen, with a very small figure and a very big sash, to the elegance of whose manners matrimony had nothing to add. She already had all the airs of a hostess, receiving the company, shaking her fan, saying that with so many people to attend to she should have no time to dance. She made a long speech about Mr. Townsend's cousin, to whom she administered a tap with her fan before turning away to other cares. Catherine had not understood all that she said; her attention was given to enjoying Marian's ease of manner and flow of ideas, and to looking at the young man, who was remarkably handsome. She had succeeded, however, as she often failed to do when people were presented to her, in catching his name, which appeared to be the same as that of Marian's little stockbroker. Catherine was always agitated by an introduction; it seemed a difficult moment, and she wondered that some people--her new acquaintance at this moment, for instance-- should mind it so little. She wondered what she ought to say, and what would be the consequences of her saying nothing. The consequences at present were very agreeable. Mr. Townsend, leaving her no time for embarrassment, began to talk with an easy smile, as if he had known her for a year. ",

Also he owned ships and did much commerce with Holland, France, yes, and with Spain and Italy. Indeed, although he appeared so humble, his wealth was very large and always increased, like a snowball rolling down a hill; moreover, he owned much land, especially in the neighbourhood of London where it was likely to grow in value. \n\n\"Money melts,\" he would say, \"furs corrupt with moth and time, and thieves break in and steal.

He was turning 7 years old, which in dinosaur years, that means he was going to be an adult! There were so many different things he was going to do! He knew that there was going to be a moon bounce, and that he was going to get a lot of presents from all of his dinosaur friends, but the thing that he was most excited about, was the cake! Larry's favorite food was cake, and he hoped that they got the right flavor. Larry's favorite flavor was banana. Larry went to school that day and everyone told him happy birthday! When he came home from school, all the lights were out. \"Hello?\" Larry said, as he came into the house. All of the sudden, the lights went on, and there was everyone! \"Happy birthday Larry!\" all of his friends shouted. Confetti went everywhere. \"Where is the cake?\" he asked. \"Here it is!\" said his mom, and brought out the cake. \"It's a chocolate cake, like you wanted!\" Larry froze. \"I said that I wanted a banana cake.\" said Larry. He was very sad. \"Now the party is going to be no fun.\" \"Oh Larry.\" said his mom. \"Your friends are here, and we worked very hard to set up this party for you! Please at least go spend some time with your friends.\" Larry was sad, but he tried to have fun. And the more he tried to have fun, the more he liked the party. The moon bounce was fun, and the gifts were very nice. He found out that you can still have fun even when things don't go as planned.",

Gemini missions developed some of the space travel techniques that were necessary for the success of the Apollo missions. Apollo used Saturn family rockets as launch vehicles. Apollo/Saturn vehicles were also used for an Apollo Applications Program, which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973\u201374, and the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project, a joint Earth orbit mission with the Soviet Union in 1975.",

Joe Lieberman, the committee chairman, told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n\n\"Why wasn't it noticed if that was the case? What's the Secret Service going to do to make sure it never happens again?\" \n\nSome Secret Service members and agents allegedly brought back several prostitutes to a hotel in Cartagena, according to sources familiar with the U.S. government's investigation. \n\nThe Secret Service says 12 members of the agency have been implicated in the incident. \n\nAcross the Sunday political talk shows, officials expressed confidence in Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, saying they believe he has handled the scandal well and will get answers. \n\n\"History is full of cases where enemies have compromised\" people with security or intelligence information through sex, said Lieberman, I-Connecticut. He added that based on what he has been told so far, \"there is no evidence that information was compromised\" in this case. \n\nDown the road, the committee will hold a public hearing on the matter -- perhaps more than one, Lieberman said.

We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question. \n\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. \n\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, \"She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.\" \n\n\"What does Bessie say I have done?\" I asked. \n\n\"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.

Jean-Pierre Blanchard flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785. \n\nRigid airships became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German Zeppelin company.",

      "story": "Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle in Oceania. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \"moai\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. \n\nPolynesian people most likely settled on Easter Island sometime between 700 and 1100 CE, and created a thriving and industrious culture as evidenced by the island's numerous enormous stone \"moai\" and other artefacts. However, human activity, the introduction of the Polynesian rat and overpopulation led to gradual deforestation and extinction of natural resources which severely weakened the Rapa Nui civilization. By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population had dropped to 2,000\u20133,000 from an estimated high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier. European diseases and Peruvian slave raiding in the 1860s further reduced the Rapa Nui population, to a low of only 111 inhabitants in 1877. \n\nEaster Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. The nearest inhabited land (around 50 residents in 2013) is Pitcairn Island, away; the nearest town with a population over 500 is Rikitea, on the island of Mangareva, away; the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, away.",

Once I did get that out, a lot of fun came.\" \n\nDuff married Comrie, a former pro hockey player, in 2010 after dating for three years. Their son, Luca, was born in 2012. Duff and Comrie announced their separation in January. \n\nDuff, 26, admits that she's \"nervous\" after being away from music for seven years. Her just-released single, \"Chasing the Sun,\" is from her still-untitled album, which will be her first studio release since 2007's \"Dignity.\" \n\nShe says she first started thinking of new material when she was pregnant with her son. After having the child and taking another year, she was even more anxious. \n\n\"I felt like I was missing a big part of myself,\" she said. \n\nDuff established a successful singing career on the heels of her popular Disney show, \"Lizzie McGuire,\" which aired from 2001 to 2004. She spent most of her teenage years touring and says that turning 20 was a big factor in leaving the road. \n\n\"It was time for me to be a person, and the break just ended up being a long time,\" she said.

But he stood unmoved, and, for a single instant, they absolutely faltered. \n\n\"Cowards!\" cried Salem, and he flung himself upon him. The steel descended like a ray of light; but did no harm; for the sailor's heart was beating against the Mowree's before he was aware. \n\nThey both fell to the deck, when the knife was instantly seized, and Bembo secured. \n\n\"For'ard! for'ard with him!\" was again the cry; \"give him a sea-toss!\" \"Overboard with him!\" and he was dragged along the deck, struggling and fighting with tooth and nail. \n\nAll this uproar immediately over the mate's head at last roused him from his drunken nap, and he came staggering on deck. \n\n\"What's this?\" he shouted, running right in among them. \n\n\"It's the Mowree, zur; they are going to murder him, zur,\" here sobbed poor Rope Yarn, crawling close up to him. \n\n\"Avast! avast!\" roared Jermin, making a spring toward Bembo, and dashing two or three of the sailors aside.

      "story": "(CNN) -- Money talks -- that's hardly a revelation, but the overriding feeling towards Saturday's David Haye versus Dereck Chisora \"circus fight\" in London is shock and outrage that it could even take place. \n\nWith neither fighter holding a British boxing license, promoter Frank Warren had to resort to asking the little-known Luxembourg federation to sanction the bout. \n\nIt has since been expelled from the European Boxing Union for agreeing to give legitimacy to an event that no-one else would touch. \n\nChisora was banned by the World Boxing Council and the British Boxing Board of Control following his bust-up with Haye in Munich in February, while his former world champion opponent escaped punishment only because he had already retired. \n\nTheir ugly scuffle at a press conference after Chisora's defeat by Vitali Klitschko, which Haye attended, has set the scene for a showdown straight from the pages of the professional wrestling handbook. \n\nTheir pantomime behavior has only served to rack up the ticket sales to close to 30,000 and secure airtime in 60 countries worldwide. \n\nChisora threatens to shoot Haye \n\n\"Chisora's not a nice guy, the fact he bites people in the ring, spits water in peoples' faces, slaps people at weigh-ins, kisses people at weigh-ins. What's to like?\" Haye said this week. \n\nBoxing commentator Steve Bunce has compared Haye and Chisora's Munich brawl to Lennox Lewis' pre-fight rumble with Mike Tyson a decade ago. Lewis punched Tyson, and in exchange the American bit his leg. This was heralded at the time as the biggest fight ever. ",

      "story": "Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. \n\nGreenland is the world's largest island (Australia, although larger, is generally considered to be a continental landmass rather than an island). Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. With a population of about 56,480 (2013), it is the least densely populated country in the world. The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry acts as a lifeline for western Greenland, connecting the various cities and settlements. \n\nGreenland has been inhabited off and on for at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada. Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, and Inuit peoples arrived in the 13th century. The Norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th\u00a0century. Soon after their demise, beginning in 1499, the Portuguese briefly explored and claimed the island, naming it \"Terra do Lavrador\" (later applied to Labrador in Canada). In the early 18th century, Scandinavian explorers reached Greenland again. To strengthen trading and power, Denmark-Norway affirmed sovereignty over the island.",

At one o'clock in the morning Leigh rose and, with his three followers, started for the village. It was but twenty minutes' walk. Not a soul was stirring, not a light visible in any window. \n\nThey found that three or four boats were lying by the bank. Leigh chose the smallest of these and, loosening the head rope from the post to which it was fastened, took his place in her with the others.

Then he sent one of his followers westward. \n\n\"You will follow the road,\" he said, \"until within a mile of Tours; then you will conceal yourself, and watch who passes along. If you see a large body of troops coming, you will at once strike across country and make your way down to the village above that at which we crossed. You heard the instructions that I gave to Pierre. If you find him and the others there with the boat, you will report what you have seen. He will send another messenger on with the news to Cathelineau, and you will remain with him until I arrive. \n\n\"If he is not there, you will follow the bank of the river down to the other village. You will give a shout as you pass the spot where we halted. If no answer comes, you will probably find Pierre and the boat somewhere below. You will not miss him, for I have ordered him to post two of your comrades on the bank, so that you cannot pass them unseen.

First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man Project Mercury which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" by the end of the 1960s, which he proposed in a May 25, 1961, address to Congress. Project Mercury was followed by the two-man Project Gemini (1962\u201366). The first manned flight of Apollo was in 1968. \n\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, and was supported by the two-man Gemini program which ran concurrently with it from 1962 to 1966. Gemini missions developed some of the space travel techniques that were necessary for the success of the Apollo missions. Apollo used Saturn family rockets as launch vehicles. Apollo/Saturn vehicles were also used for an Apollo Applications Program, which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973\u201374, and the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project, a joint Earth orbit mission with the Soviet Union in 1975.",

We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question. \n\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. \n\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, \"She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.\" \n\n\"What does Bessie say I have done?\" I asked. \n\n\"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.

As it was, he was too miserable to wait any longer; for his last hope--a letter--had failed him. It was fully due to-day; it had not come. Had his father really flung him away? It looked so. It was not like his father, but it surely looked so. His father was a rather tough nut, in truth, but had never been so with his son--still, this implacable silence had a calamitous look. Anyway, Tracy would go to the Towers and --then what? He didn't know; his head was tired out with thinking-- he wouldn't think about what he must do or say--let it all take care of itself.

The word \"aviation\" was coined by French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863, from the verb \"avier\" (synonymous flying), itself derived from the Latin word \"avis\" (\"bird\") and the suffix \"-ation\". \n\nThere are early legends of human flight such as the story of Icarus in Greek myth and Jamshid in Persian myth, and later, somewhat more credible claims of short-distance human flights appear, such as the flying automaton of Archytas of Tarentum (428\u2013347 BC), the winged flights of Abbas Ibn Firnas (810\u2013887), Eilmer of Malmesbury (11th century), and the hot-air Passarola of Bartholomeu Louren\u00e7o de Gusm\u00e3o (1685\u20131724). \n\nThe modern age of aviation began with the first untethered human lighter-than-air flight on November 21, 1783, of a hot air balloon designed by the Montgolfier brothers. The practicality of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. It was immediately recognized that a steerable, or dirigible, balloon was required. Jean-Pierre Blanchard flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785. \n\nRigid airships became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German Zeppelin company.",

Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \"moai\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. \n\nPolynesian people most likely settled on Easter Island sometime between 700 and 1100 CE, and created a thriving and industrious culture as evidenced by the island's numerous enormous stone \"moai\" and other artefacts. However, human activity, the introduction of the Polynesian rat and overpopulation led to gradual deforestation and extinction of natural resources which severely weakened the Rapa Nui civilization. By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population had dropped to 2,000\u20133,000 from an estimated high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier. European diseases and Peruvian slave raiding in the 1860s further reduced the Rapa Nui population, to a low of only 111 inhabitants in 1877. \n\nEaster Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. The nearest inhabited land (around 50 residents in 2013) is Pitcairn Island, away; the nearest town with a population over 500 is Rikitea, on the island of Mangareva, away; the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, away.",

Rowe, \"agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist\". Agnosticism is a doctrine or set of s rather than a religion. \n\nEnglish biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the word \"agnostic\" in 1869. Earlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as Sanjaya Belatthaputta, a 5th-century BCE Indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife; and Protagoras, a 5th-century BCE Greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of \"the gods\". The Nasadiya Sukta in the Rigveda is agnostic about the origin of the universe. \n\nBeing a scientist, above all else, Huxley presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Money talks -- that's hardly a revelation, but the overriding feeling towards Saturday's David Haye versus Dereck Chisora \"circus fight\" in London is shock and outrage that it could even take place. \n\nWith neither fighter holding a British boxing license, promoter Frank Warren had to resort to asking the little-known Luxembourg federation to sanction the bout. \n\nIt has since been expelled from the European Boxing Union for agreeing to give legitimacy to an event that no-one else would touch. \n\nChisora was banned by the World Boxing Council and the British Boxing Board of Control following his bust-up with Haye in Munich in February, while his former world champion opponent escaped punishment only because he had already retired. \n\nTheir ugly scuffle at a press conference after Chisora's defeat by Vitali Klitschko, which Haye attended, has set the scene for a showdown straight from the pages of the professional wrestling handbook. \n\nTheir pantomime behavior has only served to rack up the ticket sales to close to 30,000 and secure airtime in 60 countries worldwide. \n\nChisora threatens to shoot Haye \n\n\"Chisora's not a nice guy, the fact he bites people in the ring, spits water in peoples' faces, slaps people at weigh-ins, kisses people at weigh-ins. What's to like?\" Haye said this week. \n\nBoxing commentator Steve Bunce has compared Haye and Chisora's Munich brawl to Lennox Lewis' pre-fight rumble with Mike Tyson a decade ago. Lewis punched Tyson, and in exchange the American bit his leg. This was heralded at the time as the biggest fight ever. ",

      "story": "Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. \n\nGreenland is the world's largest island (Australia, although larger, is generally considered to be a continental landmass rather than an island). Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. With a population of about 56,480 (2013), it is the least densely populated country in the world. The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry acts as a lifeline for western Greenland, connecting the various cities and settlements. \n\nGreenland has been inhabited off and on for at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada. Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, and Inuit peoples arrived in the 13th century. The Norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th\u00a0century. Soon after their demise, beginning in 1499, the Portuguese briefly explored and claimed the island, naming it \"Terra do Lavrador\" (later applied to Labrador in Canada). In the early 18th century, Scandinavian explorers reached Greenland again. To strengthen trading and power, Denmark-Norway affirmed sovereignty over the island.",

      "story": "A news agency (French: \"agence de presse\") is an organization that gathers news reports and sells them to subscribing news organizations, such as newspapers, magazines and radio and television broadcasters. A news agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire, or news service. \n\nAlthough there are many news agencies around the world, three global news agencies, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Associated Press (AP) and Reuters, have offices in most countries of the world and cover all areas of information. All three began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers; they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers. Jonathan Fenby explains the philosophy: \n\nTo achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality. Demonstrably correct information is their stock in trade. Traditionally, they report at a reduced level of responsibility, attributing their information to a spokesman, the press, or other sources. They avoid making judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity. Though their founders did not use the word, objectivity is the philosophical basis for their enterprises \u2013 or failing that, widely acceptable neutrality. \n\nOnly a few large newspapers could afford bureaus outside their home city. They relied instead on news agencies, especially Havas (founded 1835) in France and the Associated Press (founded 1846) in the United States. Former Havas employees founded Reuters in 1851 in Britain and Wolff in 1849 in Germany; Havas is now Agence France-Presse (AFP). For international news, the agencies pooled their resources, so that Havas, for example, covered the French Empire, South America and the Balkans and shared the news with the other national agencies. In France the typical contract with Havas provided a provincial newspaper with 1800 lines of telegraphed text daily, for an annual subscription rate of 10,000 francs. Other agencies provided features and fiction for their subscribers.",

      "story": "Jim rode his bike quickly. It was Friday and he wanted to get to the lake. The path to the lake was long and winding. It was wetter on Tuesday. Jim had to wash his boot. His boot had once been frozen. It was frozen because he left it outside on Sunday. He had to leave his boot outside for a long time. The lake was facing the tree. Jim had to go home. He wanted food very badly. Jim went home. He got inside and looked up at the ceiling. He walked to the refrigerator. Jim took the yogurt out of the refrigerator. Some milk was on the table and he grabbed a cup so he could pour himself some of the milk. Jim also had a candy bar. Jim sat down and rested. He was tired from the long bike ride. He finished his yogurt and began planning his next trip to the lake. It would not be long before he returned. He and his boots were ready for more fun outdoors Monday.",

      "story": "Kerry was playing with his toy airplane in the backyard after school one day when he saw something moving in the corner of the yard. He put down his toy and went over to look. He found a small frog, about two inches cross, jumping across the grass. \n\nCarefully, Kerry followed the frog as it jumped across the grass. He didn't know where the frog had come from or where it was going, but he knew that frogs needed water. He wanted to help the frog. \n\nHe ran inside and got a plastic pail that he used to use at the beach for sand. He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard. \n\nIt took him some time to find the frog again. It seemed to be moving slower than it had before. He waited for it to pause, then scooped it up with his bare hands and dropped it into the water. He watched the frog swim around for a bit, and then carried the pail around to the front of the house. \n\nIt was a short way to a nearby creek running through his neighborhood. Kerry walked slowly, trying not to spill the water. The pail seemed to grow heavier and heavier as he walked. Finally, he reached the creek. He set the pail down next to the water and tipped it over until the frog was swimming in the stream.",

      "story": "Joey got a German Shepherd for his birthday present. He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend. After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun. Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back. Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present.",
